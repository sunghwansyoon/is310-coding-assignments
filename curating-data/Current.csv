         From: Martin Mueller 
         Subject: Re: 21.541 ""anywhere you want to go""

In thinking about the computer as a kind of automobile,  Willard
raises the troubling question ""What happens to a city whose urban
planners think only in terms of the automobile?""  A good question from
the pedestrian's or cyclist's perspective.  But let's be fair to
automobiles, trains, and planes:  if one of your great pleasures in
life is hiking in the mountains (as it true of me),  how do you get to
wherever you want to hike in the first place?

A major minor character in Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain (1923)  is the
train that brings people to the then still rather sleepy Davos. A lot
of hiking and cycling depends on other modes of transportation. The
application to humanities computing is obvious--or not so obvious. I
think there are two major factors that stand in the way of the
intelligent and imaginative use of information technology in the
humanities.  The first of these is the myth, encouraged by consumer
oriented applications of technology, that you can interesting
scholarly things by pushing some combination of buttons, and that if
you can't learn to push those buttons in five minutes, it isn't worth
doing or the program sucks. The second is the humanist's fear that the
technology will take over and replace treasured forms of human(e)
inquiry.  But think of the new, strenuous, and pleasurable forms of
hiking or skiing that are enabled by technology. Switzerland is after
all a triumph of civil engineering. And if one thinks of the
humanities as a kind of Switzerland, perhaps it points to productive
ways of seeing the interaction of man and machine (I am aware of
aspects of Switzerland where the humanities perhaps do not want to go)

         From: Willard McCarty 
         Subject: the 21st time around the Maypole

Today is Humanist's 21st birthday! Some of you 
have been around since the very beginning, many 
for many years. So most everyone here knows that 
on 7 May every year I post a HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
message, taking a bit of time out not just to 
celebrate longevity but also to reflect on 
Humanist's conceptual wanderings during the year.

This time allow me to do these things by drawing 
your attention to four bits of writing, whose 
conjunction to my mind sums up what this 
whatever-it-is has been about since it began, in 
1987, when the humanities were nearing the end of 
their palaeo-electronic age. I come to the 
following construction because the necessarily 
extra-/inter-disciplinary position of humanities 
computing gives us quite a balancing act to 
perform, help with which is never superfluous. To 
put this another way, it is useful if not vital 
for us to be reminded that being in play rather 
than at rest, or in still another way, remaining 
in conversation rather than at the conclusion of 
whatever argument (or worse, persuaded by 
whatever sales-pitch), is the trick perpetually 
to be performed. We need our wakeup calls. So I give you the following:

(1) The first three paragraphs in the Preface to 
Erwin Schrödinger, What is Life? (1943), in which 
he states his excuse for venturing beyond his 
area of specialization (theoretical physics, that is):

 >A scientist is supposed to have a complete and
 >thorough knowledge, at first hand, of some
 >subjects and, therefore, is usually expected not
 >to write on any topic of which he is not a
 >master. This is regarded as a matter of noblesse
 >oblige. For the present purpose I beg to
 >renounce the noblesse, if any, and to be freed
 >of the ensuing obligation. My excuse is as follows:
 >
 >We have inherited from our forefathers the keen
 >longing for unified, all-embracing knowledge.
 >The very name given to the highest institutions
 >of learning reminds us, that from antiquity and
 >throughout many centuries the universal aspect
 >has been the only one to be given full credit.
 >But the spread, both in width and depth, of the
 >multifarious branches of knowledge during the
 >last hundred odd years has confronted us with a
 >queer dilemma. We feel clearly that we are only
 >now beginning to acquire reliable material for
 >welding together the sum total of all that is
 >known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it
 >has become next to impossible for a single mind

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Happy 22nd Birthday!

If a dog seems to live 7 times faster than a human, how fast does an 
online seminar like Humanist age in our sight? How old do we Humanists 
feel? Like the 22 year-old clinging to the belief that he or she can do 
anything but beginning to suspect otherwise? Like the 154 year-old (22 * 
7 = 154) who cannot behave properly? Like an ageless sage?

A marvellous, wonderful celebration of Humanist's 21st birthday was 
staged by Lisa Lena Opas-HÃ¤nninen at DH2008 almost a year ago, at which 
not a few digital grandees were to be seen drinking liberally to its 
health. (See the post-sauna 
http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/gallery/pages/IMG_4445.html and its 
unsteady sequels.) A few years back I recall making some claim or other 
about Humanist coming of age at 18, by which time few of its original 
members remained, many having grown too old or too busy with heavy 
matters of state to remain in this playpen of ideas and, as we say, 
information. Now we're 22. I sit here in my 109 year-old Victorian 
London house with the latest building project underway (a conservatory, 
and beautiful it will be once it is done...) marvelling at the dizzying 
speed with which Humanist's 22nd continuous year of existence has 
passed. Although it may be said that the handbasket headed for Hell 
continues its lamentable journey filled with most things we value, there 
are moments when the view (I am imagining, unaccountably, the view from 
a ski-lift or mountain-top) gives back blessings all out of proportion 
to the efforts invested in getting here. This ritual occasion, on 7 May 
every year when I send out a birthday message, allows me publically to 
notice them, or at least to notice that blessings are bestowed and then 
to let you fill in the details for yourself. And to all those (if there 
be any) who grumble objections at blessedness such as it is among 
digital humanists, I recommend Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952), in which 
the perfect bureaucrat (spitting image of the one Turing used to help 
him think his way through the Entscheidungsproblem) gets up from his 
desk, shows us what's what and dies in a state of grace.

This 7th May is special for Humanist because it marks the nearly 
seamless move to digitalhumanities.org and completely successful trial 
of the new automatic mechanisms designed for it by Malgosia Askanas 
(good job indeed) and funded by the Alliance of Digital Humanities 
Organizations (to which, to whom many thanks). As one member remarked, 
the move has been unremarkable because almost completely invisible; my 
reply was, thatâs true craftsmanship. If all the gears are perfectly 
meshed, the changeover from messages numbered 22.xxx to 23.xxx today 
will have been automatic too. Previously this had to be done by hand. 
But the major improvements are those that make my life easier as editor 
in the day-to-day task of scooping up postings and posting them. What 
you observe (if that's the right word and I remain mindful of the gift) 
is a happier editor.

This 7th May is special for me professionally as being in the midst of 
my efforts to unearth the wherewithal from which, I hope, a genuine 
history of literary computing will emerge. Those who have spent much 
time in archives will know what it means to be turning up loads of 
mundane stuff, which is all to the purpose, but from time to time 
unearthing a gem. My latest gems, for example, are Edmund Callis 
Berkeley's Giant Brains, or Machines that Think (New York, John Wiley & 
Sons, 1949); Martin Mann, ""Want to Buy a Brain?"", Popular Science 
Monthly, May 1949: 148-52; a warning against such use of language for 
computers, G. R. Stibitz, ""A Note on 'Is' and 'Might Be' in Computers"", 
Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation 4.31 (July): 168-9; 
and a doctoral dissertation covering the ground, David P. Julyk, ""'The 
Trouble with Machines is People.' The Computer as Icon in Post-War 
America: 1946-1970"" (Michigan, 2008). Then there's Rich Didday, Finite 
State Fantasies (Matrix, 1976), a comic book with a story, ""Escape"", 
about a teenage boy who retreats into his room, constructs a VR machine 
from a kit, hooks it to his television, builds a virtual world (an Eden, 
presumably, including a naked woman), then strips off his clothes, dives 
through the screen and flies off with her in a manner familiar to us 
from Second Life. And on the other side of the street is Walter M. 
Mathews and Kaye Reifers, ""The Computer in Cartoons: A Retrospective 
from the Saturday Review"", Communications of the ACM 27.11 (1984): 1114-9.

These are gems because they help make a history from a catalogue of 
activities and achievements. All the stuff turned up serves as a 
reminder of how much we have forgotten. The gems (yes, including the 
comic books, wacko rants, hype and techno-enthusiasms some now would 
wish permanently forgotten) are gems because they speak to the rounded 
humanity of computing humanists now old, very old or dead who did more 
than prepare concordances for print or whatever else. Theyâre gems 
because they give us clues as to why certain things happened and others 
did not. They speak to the silences in the historical record. They 
illumine certain odd statements here and there. And they eventually, I 
hope, will amount to a âhistory of the presentâ, as Foucault said, i.e. 
a history that speaks to and helps us out with our current predicaments.

Marvin Minsky said somewhere that science doesnât need history â it just 
forges ahead. Heâs a mischievous imp, and a very bright one. But Thomas 
Kuhn is, I think, more important for us at this point, esp in showing us 
what a difference an historical view of progressive disciplines can do 
for them.

Before blowing out the candles, make a wish!

Yours, with best wishes,
WM

The iSchools (http://www.ischools.org) project represents a group of 
schools committed to the idea that expertise in all forms of information 
is required for progress in science, business, education, and culture. 
This expertise includes understanding of the uses and users of 
information, and of the nature of information itself, as well as 
information technologies and their applications. 

Criteria for being recognized as an iSchool are not rigid, but schools 
are expected to have substantial sponsored research activity (an average 
of $1 million in research expenditures per year over three years), 
engagement in educating future researchers (usually through a 
research-oriented doctoral program), and a commitment to progress in the 
information field.

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Happy 23rd Birthday!


I'm reminded of Humanist's annual birthday event these last few years by 
automatic devices, now my iPhone. Unlike the birthday of a person, who 
eventually does not want his or her age to be noted or is too busy with 
other things to be around for the celebration, Humanist exists only in 
outbursts of prose which in effect celebrate its existence these last 23 
years. For those too young or too recently among us to know, Humanist 
dates back to a moment at a conference in Columbia, South Carolina, when 
Michael Sperberg-McQueen provoked the thought in me that we all should 
talk to each other more. That's what really happened (eigentlich!), 
although what I would have said at the time was that the couple of dozen 
people at the impromptu gathering of disgruntled colleagues had a 
revolution to start, and you cannot do that without conspiratorial 
passing of messages. I suppose one could say now that many of us here 
are living the outcome of that revolution, though I'd have to admit that 
us few were not the first expression of the revolutionary impulse -- Joe 
Raben was there to remind us we had a history. As Fidel has said many, 
many times, the revolution is nothing unless it continues.

A perfect example of what Humanist is all about is to my mind Wendell 
Piez's characteristically magnanimous and insightful response yesterday 
to an outburst of mine on markup, it in turn provoked by Desmond 
Schmidt's, in a conversation on the topic stretching far enough around 
the globe to be simultaneously vernal and autumnal. I have been feeling 
(perhaps in part because of my own rather bewildering heap of birthdays, 
stretching back to the time when Fr Busa got started) that Fidel's point 
has been lost in the industrialisation of humanities computing that has 
followed in the wake of TEI's great success. I have been worrying that 
the central mission of the humanities, to make/find problems where none 
were before (how I wish we could hear the two resonances of the word 
""invent"" simultaneously!) has been forgotten within the digital 
humanities by those who have found themselves all too comfortable in the 
mind-laced straitjacket of implementing someone else's ideas. 

And then I wake up from the nightmare and find Wendell, whose 
philosophical bedside manner is better than sunshine streaming through 
the blinds. CONVERSATION, not what Donald MacCrimmon MacKay apparently, 
somewhere I cannot find, called ""competitive monologue"", but real 
conversation. I think at this point of Warren McCulloch's marvellous 
""The Fun of Failures"", Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 156.0 
(April 1969): 963-8, in which he quotes MacKay and gives us an idea of 
what a powerfully questioning mind is like. ""Teaching and learning"", 
McCulloch writes there, ""are not what Donald MacKay calls competitive 
monologue, but dialogue in which each exposes the inadequacies of his 
map of the world for his partner to complete or correct."" Isn't that 
what it's all about for our kind, however geeky, however scholarly? 
Better than collaboration, the whole point of collaboration. We make 
things, sure, but in order better to question through their anomalous 
behaviours or results.

Permit me to tell a story I have likely told several times here. One of 
the things that really got up my nose (a marvellous Britishism, no?) in 
those days when Humanist began was the widely used metaphor of the 
""clearinghouse"" of information, which was what some thought was  needed. 
I had been with my auntie many times as a lad to clearing-out sales at 
department stores, which would throw open their doors at the advertised 
hour in the morning to crowds of shoppers, who would then in a mad rush 
dive at tables where clothing on sale was piled and grab, sometimes in a 
tug-of-war, at particular items. This is what came to mind when 
""clearinghouse"" was mentioned. Wrong for all sorts of reasons, 
especially because acquisition of objects was the putative goal. I am 
guessing that what really motivated my auntie wasn't the nice frock she 
hoped to grab, or not exactly, but a mixture of some vision of life 
promised by that frock and the chance to interact with those she 
probably at the time wished would die or at least go away. Conversation 
plus the ever-elusive truth, or as Plato knew perfectly well, desire.

Which is where I always begin and end. 

Happy Birthday Humanist! And thanks to everyone here, and to everyone who has come and gone, for making these conversations possible. This certainly includes the lurkers. I note, suddenly questioning that term an interesting development chronicled in the Oxford English Dictionary, the following:

-----
LURKER

1. One who lurks or lies concealed: freq. employed as a term of abuse in early quots. lit. and fig. [quotations 1325-1870]
2.  A begging impostor; a petty thief. [quotations 1842-1973]
3. App[arently] misused for LURCHER [quotation 1440]

DRAFT ADDITIONS JULY 2001 

Chiefly Computing slang. A person who reads communications to an electronic network without actively contributing. [quotations 1984-1998]
-----

>From this I conclude that computing brings out in us a playful spirit and has overall a most civilising effect!

Thank you all!


Yours,
WM

Today Humanist begins its 25th, quarter-century year. In usual and 
generously imprecise human terms, we could say that a generation has 
passed and that we're on to the next one. I certainly get that sense 
from encountering whole collections of writings on the digital 
humanities, not just published but some time ago, that I knew nothing 
about until accidentially encountering them. This at first is shocking 
because I am always on the prowl. But as my friend Harold Short remarked 
a few days ago, our divergences of ideas, views, opinions, organizations 
and everything else are signs of vigour. It's what happens to fields 
that succeed. Perhaps they go to seed, but then those seeds, some of 
them, germinate and sprout and grow. Those of us who think we have *said 
it* just have to accept that it is (because we are) a living thing which 
mutates, has babies and that argues with itself. In the latest thing I 
am writing I've been dealing with a book review that sharply levels the 
charge of disunity of opinion at a branch of our field, arguings that 
the lack of consensus is a sure sign of failure. What's got me going is 
the author's evident need to think that computing is all about coming up 
with the correct answer (which unsurprisingly he thinks should turn out 
to agree rather closely with received knowledge about the subject). 
After all, we've given the field he has put in the dock 30 or more years 
to come up with the goods, and all we get are more questions!

What's much, much more difficult to accept than our comfortably small 
subculture spinning out of our control is that with the passing of a 
generation people pass. We can say, as Gregory Bateson once did, that 
room needs to be made for the next generation, not just or even 
primarily in the physical sense. (Bateson was such a man that he may 
well have said this or thought it on his deathbed.) Ideas and their 
expressions turn into prisons needing to be torn down and remade. And so 
on and so forth. There are many other comforting thoughts which we can 
have that, I suppose, all come down to the cycle of nature in one form 
or another. ""But old age should burn and rage at close of day"". ""And I 
am dumb to tell the lover's tomb"" anything at all.

So I remember Chuck Bush, who died on 13 April, for who he was. As far 
as I can recall he was there, at the International Conference on 
Computing in the Humanities (ICCH) in 1987, in Columbia, South Carolina, 
when I started in the then small community and after which, from 
inspiration at the event, Humanist began. He was then as friendly, 
stalwart and faithful as he remained throughout the following years. 
Solid as a rock, until suddenly he wasn't.

With news of his death various things have been done and others are 
planned. The official online memorial is at 
aurora-22360.tributes.com/show/Charles--Chuck--Bush-91259514. I have 
made desultory effort to collect remembrances of Chuck in addition to 
the brief expressions which flooded the internal ACH Executive list. 
Here are two.

""He was a good man"", Steve Ramsay wrote on 14 April, and like Steve ""I 
will miss his kindly bearing and his good sense.  He will be dearly 
missed.""

Harold sent me ""one general and one specific observation about Chuck"":

> The general one is to do with the way he combined thoughtfulness and
> good humour.  He had a way of blinking that always seemed to me a
> sure sign he was thinking - i.e. he had listened to what you had to
> say and he was reflecting on it, a trait one might wish for in all

Simple gifts. Farewell, Chuck. Happy birthday, Humanist.

Yours,
WM

""Electronic philology is not only a way to make things faster and
inventories more accurate. It is not just a tool. It is also, more
deeply, a change in our attitude."" (F.A. Marcos Marin, 1998, in New Media
and the Humanities: Research and Applications ed. D. Fiormonte and J.
Usher, 2001, p.19)

In spite of the attitude we take, whether for historical reasons, or
because the situation demands it, to regard the computer as ""just a
tool"", the fact remains that the addition of the tool to the task always
changes the task. Even the example Willard gave of the mainframe
computer that they all regarded as just a tool because it was kept in a
separate room and didn't much interact with them, changed forever their
methods of working and the sort of things they could do.

The tendency for you to call something ""just a tool"" might be inversely 
proportional to your degree of interaction with it.

Hello Willard and Humanist readers (and ""ponderers"")

Another year as the wheel turns.  Congratulations to you Willard for seeing us through another cycle of the years!  Indeed, 26 is something like ""maturity""---hopefully not creaky old age, of which some of us are too aware; may there by 26 more, and more.  And if we add the UToronto predecessor to Humanist (alas, my fading memory has forgotten the name   :-(    ) Willard deserves credit for more than 26.  And speaking of blogs, twitter, etc. I suppose I show my age, but that is just too much information (some of it pretty random) to digest---either quickly or slowly.  But I show my age in that comment.  Humanist moves ""slowly"" so to speak, but hopefully it moves thoughtfully and reflectively (not that a blog is not thoughtful and reflective also!)

I give less attention to Humanist than I should (I keep a closer focus on some current research/translation projects). But the digital humanities stay on my mind.  And yes, interdisciplinary, or as I have now heard, collaborative research is flourishing in some quarters---but it hard to see what the best model for achieving true collaboration will be.  Surely the possibility of quick, easy and detailed (textual, aural and visual) communication over vast distances is one element that is present now that was absent when Humanist stuck its foot into the flow of electrons.  I'm struck (from a weekly lunch with retired colleagues that includes scientists and one in particular who is still conducting research, how in certain fields (his is chemistry) you have to collaborate with others for reasons of lab equipment, expertise in the nitty gritty or the purely theoretical, etc etc.  I note with great interest (since I seem to be combining theology, spirituality, exegesis and iconography some of my endeavors) that the U. of Chicago has a new program (and building!!) dedicated to collaborative research (with funding!!!) chaired by David Nirenberg (who just spoke at Oberlin on the topic of his newest book).  I also discovered (probably old news to many on this list) that Notre Dame has a Mellon grant for interdisciplinary research/workshops on Literature and Religion, Music and Religion, and other combinations.  Perhaps, to take up Willard's comment near the endof his reflections---we ourselves have to envision and actualize (and encourage) work that brings disciplines together as much as we can in our own work, while drawing other people into the 'mix"" and furthering (and perhaps being a bit activist about it) interdisciplinary conversations.  

Well, enough for now.  I've not posted in at least 26 ""dog years"".  So to close, Happy Birthday Humanist!

best

Dear Willard,

I sincerely doubted sending this in, and at several moments hovered with my
finger above the trash can icon. But I guess Humanist should be the judge
on this. I'm truly sorry but your subject, excerpt, and comment totally
pushed my rant-button. However subjective, this is an account of true
experience with an edge on social structureâ¦ handle with care I guess.

â¦

No, I don't think that boundary is moving at all. Let me explain that by
telling a story. This is not my story. This is a story about a man who is a
builder. He is a builder of software. In the true fashion of computer
science he regards himself as a problem solver. But he is working in a
humanities environment. This makes for some uncomfortable feelings of
mismatch, as it turns out after a while that humanities has no problems to
really solve. Our protagonist finds that humanities studies problems,
offers perspectives, articulates possible meanings, paints a multitude of
critical perceptions. Some arguments seem more valid than others, depending
strongly on context, but all are seemingly valuable. But the harder our
hero looks the fewer concrete problems of the type ""How do we make water
run uphill?"" crop up.

But then he discovers that at the bottom of the scientific building of
humanities, in the trenches where information is gathered, structured, and
offered for higher scrutiny, some problems-one-could-say emerge from
repetitive, mind numbing, error prone, yet highly valuable tasks: churning
out the primitives and primary data that humanities scholars need for their
synthetic analysis. This is the realm of data entry and curation, of
documentary and scholarly editing tasks that prepare the raw data to be
refined through the hands of academic scholars. Here our hero finds a first
application ground for his merit. Here's repetition. Here he can scale.
Here he can help the humanities benefit from computing power.

But the researchers do not quite see the scientific merit of that. If it is

        Subject: Happy Birthday Humanist!


Remembrance of Humanist's past, from 7 May 1987, which I yearly celebrate,
was this time triggered by something older. I was looking into the history
of our discipline and serendipitously came across a chapter by Joseph Raben,
""Content analysis and the study of poetry"", in a book on content analysis,
The Analysis of Communication Content (1969), ed. Gerbner et al. In it Raben
writes as follows:

> This chapter, on possible inferences from the content analysis of

> relationship: critics and historians of literature may learn from the
> content analysts a new and potentially valuable approach to their

How widely, I found myself wondering, do we appreciate this form of
reprocity? Ambient technological determinism works against it. The idea of
impact and the billiard-ball theory of history behind that idea impedes it.
Implementation services -- and, of course, the demand to show impact in
scholarly work -- opposes any realization of it with institutional force.

But here we have Joe Raben 46 years ago pointing to the relationship of
reciprocity between the two phenomena named in the title of his journal,
Computers and the Humanities. Experience suggests to me that we still
struggle to realise it. This is so not only because articulating ideas or
forms of research, many of them tacit, is difficult in computational terms.
We struggle also, I suspect, because the cycle of reciprocal exchange
between the two, as Langdon Winner points out in Autonomous Technology
(1977), results in technomorphic humanity as well as anthropomorphic
technology. Scary that. Easier just to lie down and be impacted?

You may be thinking that this is a strange way to begin a birthday message
to Humanist as it enters its 29th year -- even unprecedented, as presenters
on the evening news programmes are fond of saying. But, since Joe was in the
room when the idea of Humanist began, his disturbing words of alert are
especially relevant. Humanist was intended originally to do something about
our situation as then institutional, disciplinary pariahs. Now things are
different, wonderfully so, but aren't they also the same, or nearly so, as
far as Joe's disciplinary reciprocity is concerned? True, the lecture
circuit for digital humanities is an information superhighway (to quote a
quaint phrase), professorships are being advertised, PhDs being granted in
the subject. But how much closer are we to being actively reciprocal in
Raben's sense?

Much of the reciprocity I suspect is hidden (because never published) in
technical practice that surfaces when the demands of research in a
humanities discipline run into the primitive state of the technology. The
great challenge to the latter leads not only to inventions and clever
work-arounds but also to the frustration that could, perhaps sometimes does,
provide a glimpse of a better, a different computing. I wonder if the
anxiety to prove itself valuable to its institutional betters turns digital
humanities aside from such glimpses? Not that they are easy to get. Our
pretty much total lack of the means to describe them stands in the way. I
know, I use loads of words to say that I have none. :-)

Allow me to suggest on this birthday, with Joe's help from long ago, that
what matters is not what scholars know that they want or need but what they
cannot get and mostly don't pause to investigate. Not reasonable hope but
wild, impossible, frustrated desire. Decorously omitted from annual reports
and workload models, of course, but the life-blood of Humanist and other
worthy forums.

Happy Birthday Humanist!

Yours,
WM

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Happy Birthday Humanist (7 May 1987--)


Humanist begins its 30th year today. As we mark birthdays, this is its 29th
birthday, but as you will see in the following message, some think it's time
to celebrate.

How time passes, if that it what it does, whatever it is. We all know that
different kinds of biological creatures live their lives at different rates,
dogs as I recall at seven times the rate of us humans. Our technological
creatures because of technological progress, metaphorically speaking, live
out their lives at a very fast rate indeed, though not as fast as insects.
Social institutions tend to develop very slowly in relation to ourselves and
to last a very long time. But then we have the liberty of constructing their
continuity in retrospect. We calculate the 'life' of the library in
millennia, for example. So where does this leave Humanist, a mixture of
biologically based activity, technological means and social institution?

Humanist began, as some here will know already, in order to bring a few
people, scattered around the world but mostly in N America and the UK,
together to serve as a common does in a small village and to do this well.
(At the time this meant publishing messages without typos, spelling errors
and messed-up formatting.) It was then almost the only such thing available.
But as other services, e.g. personal blogs and Twitter, have come online its
most important function to my mind, perhaps now more obviously than before,
is to raise and discuss substantive questions about the developing nature of
digital humanities, the epistemology of computing, its social effects and
the like and how these draw on and contribute to the older disciplines.

An example might help here. Recently, commenting on the text of a
lecture I've just finished, an friend of mine wrote back to say,

> on the difficult topic of intuition, Aristotle, usually a stickler
> for the straight and narrow, makes a point about quickwittedness
> (agchinoia), that it is a sort of ability to hit the mark (eustochia)
> (Nicomachean Ethics 1142b5ff.). This ability turns out to be a matter
> of spotting the similarity in things that are far apart, he adds
> 'even in philosophy', i.e. not just in poetry and rhetoric (Rhetoric
> 1412a9ff). Like really good metaphor it is not a skill that can be

> board. But insofar as these passages see analogising as the key, he
> opens the door to a dialogue with you, as it seems to me.

and to a dialogue between us and the philosophers interested in such
matters. What does it mean to take computers on board in the light of
such questions?

The Humanist common remains despite the pull of the older disciplines on
activities with computing that happen to concern them in particular.
Sometimes I wonder if and sometimes am certain that colleagues in those
disciplines (unlike my friend) simply don't see that what concerns them
mutatis mutandis concerns everyone, and that its particular form in this or
that discipline tells us all something important about digital epistemology,
anthropology, sociology or whatever. Will it turn out to be that a small
band of interdisciplinary raiders continues to have far too much work to do
merely in gathering together insights from across the disciplines?

Perhaps I should not, especially on Humanist's birthday, be complaining.
Being such a raider is what I enjoy most. But in the course of an ordinary
life birthdays rather soon become occasions on which the fact of mortality
is hard to avoid. Usually the upcoming 30th marks the end of youth, the
beginning of serious maturity, when people (such as parents) begin to wonder
out loud when you're going to settle down, have children, buy a house, get a
mortgage etc. I think the anti-DH sentiment recently marked here might well
be interpreted as just such a sharp parental question. At least sometimes if
not often this question has the odour of a death-sentence. Personally I
think we should answer it on behalf of Humanist and the field it stands for
by enacting a plan for becoming differently, more interestingly, more
intelligently wild.

Happy birthday to us all!

Yours,
WM

        Subject: Significant event


Dear Willard,

Greetings from Rome via a very flaky internet connection to congratulate you and Humanist on a significant event on 7 May, when the Humanist numbering system will flick over to 30, signifying that Humanist is entering its thirtieth year of operation, moving towards its thirtieth birthday on 7 May 2017. Thirty years of a daily stream of thought-provoking, entertaining, intellectually rigorous, informative and useful postings is an amazing achievement. Humanist has played a fundamental role in the emergence of the digital humanities and has shown how new technologies can enable new disciplinary alignments.

Some of Humanist's admirers have been plotting to mark Humanist's achievement, and we cannot think of a better way of doing so than as part of the U.K. National festival of the humanities, 'Being Human', which takes place this year from 17-25 November 2016. Professor Jane Winters of the School of Advanced Study at the University of London and I will be organising an event during the festival to mark Humanistâs tyhirtieth year of operation, and further details will be given here when the programme for the festival is announced. We will be producing a digital representation of the event, which wil be linked back to material from the Humanist annals, and will be made available on Humanistâs 30th birthday in 2017.

In the meantime, Willard and Humanist, here's a Peroni beer toast to your wonderful achievement.

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Happy 30th birthday

Dear colleagues,

It is a sign of age in more than one sense, and I would like to think of 
maturity, that this 30th birthday of Humanist almost passed without my 
noticing. I only noticed because the automatic changeover of volume and 
issue to 30.1 caught my eye. It may also be more evidence that reliance 
on automata, for example in my diary reminders of appointments, 
birthdays etc, has gradually offloaded more and more bits of my 
attentiveness. There's the clever app which tells me it's time to go to 
bed in order to get a full 8 hours of sleep, and then wakes me up with 
birdsong. There's the app which times the brushing of teeth. And there 
are many other possibilities to set reminders of this and that, and 
wearable devices to give you a tap on the wrist. A good thing or a bad 
thing, or simply a thing? If attentiveness were like a bank account which 
is depleted by direct debits, then automation would be unambiguously 
depriving us of mental wealth. But it isn't. Is it?

Jessica Riskin's The Restless Clock (2016) tells us that there are 
precedents going back much further than digital machines. She plays with 
the idea of agency, divorcing consciousness from it, to come up with her 
thesis that machines are agents by being unpredictable. (If that's the 
case, then as Herman Goldstine and John von Neumann argued in 1947, the 
stored-program computer has been an agent from the get-go.) 
Interestingly she discusses the holy and unholy machines of the late 
medieval and early modern periods, arguing that their agency, as far as 
the pious were concerned, materialised for their time, for them, the 
beings their automata (shifting metaphysical gears) represented. We can 
do the same with ours for our time? 

After 30 years, now beginning the 31st, with popularity a major problem, 
with academic appointments secured, postdocs too, PhD degrees on offer, 
in progress and achieved, the dream conceived in protest in Columbia, 
South Carolina, in 1987, with Michael Sperberg-McQueen and others in a 
group of disgruntled outsiders, has to be redreamt. It seems to me that 
what's been achieved or simply come about for us to celebrate is not 
demolition of what once seemed an unbreachable stone wall but the 
opportunity to do unexpected and interesting things. Disciplines, I like 
to say and do believe, are starting points, not -- except for those 
whose ambitions go no further -- points of arrival or clubs to be 
joined. I come back to the closing sentences in Geoffrey Lloyd's The 
Ambitions of Curiosity: Understanding the World in Ancient Greece and 
China (2002) -- read it tonight!

> Both societies, I have suggested, developed basic human capacities
> for curiosity in intriguing and ingenious ways. But in both, the
> ambitions of curiosity were just that, just ambitions. But what
> ambitions: for in one context after another, they held out the hope
> of understanding what had never been understood before.

If we can understand this for ourselves and our own amorphous society -- 
that we hold out such hope -- then I think we have cause to celebrate 
this Sunday morning birthday.

Yours,
WM

Hello Charles,

You might be interested in the Catalogue of Digital Editions:
https://dig-ed-cat.eos.arz.oeaw.ac.at/

While this does not lay out the information regarding critical edition
exactly as you may be looking for - you can browse projects that are hosted
on various digital edition platforms.

There's also the DIRT directory: https://dirtdirectory.org/

This may contain more relevant information to your search for specific
platforms/tools and their pros and cons.

Best regards,

Workshops are structured in such a way that participants can either take 
the two blocks of one workshop or two blocks from different workshops. 
The number of participants in each workshop is limited to 10.

We can also *not* take more applications for CLARIN-D and ETCL 
fellowships. We received about three times more applications than the 
number of fellowships available.

The Summer University takes place across 11 whole days. The intensive 
programme consists of workshops, public lectures, regular project 
presentations, a poster session, teaser sessions and a panel discussion.

The Summer University is directed at 60 participants from all over 
Europe and beyond. It wants to bring together (doctoral) students, young 
scholars and academics from the Arts and Humanities, Library Sciences, 
Social Sciences, the Arts and Engineering and Computer Sciences as equal 
partners to an interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and experience in 
a multilingual and multicultural context and thus create the conditions 
for future project-based cooperations.

The Leipzig Summer University is special because it not only seeks to 
offer a space for the discussion and acquisition of new knowledge, 
skills and competences in those computer technologies which play a 
central role in Humanities Computing and which determine every day more 
and more the work done in the Humanities and Cultural Sciences, as well 
as in publishing, libraries, and archives etc., but because it tries to 
integrate also linguistics with the Digital Humanities, which pose 
questions about the consequences and implications of the application of 
computational methods and tools to cultural artefacts of all kinds.

It is special furthermore because it consciously aims at confronting the 
so-called Gender Divide , i.e. the under-representation of women in the 
domain of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Germany, 
Europe and many parts of the world, by relying on the challenges that 
the Humanities with their complex data and their wealth of women 
represent for Computer Science and Engineering and the further 
development of the latter, on the overcoming of the boarders between the 
so-called hard and soft sciences and on the integration of Humanities, 
Computer Science and Engineering.

As the Summer University is dedicated not only to the acquisition of 
knowledge and skills, but also wants to foster community building and 
networking across disciplines, languages and cultures, countries and 
continents, the programme of the Summer School features also communal 
coffee breaks, communal lunches in the refectory of the university, and 
a rich cultural programme (thematic guided tours, visits of archives, 
museums and exhibitions, and communal dinners in different parts of 
Leipzig).

updated and integrated with more information as soon as it becomes 
available.
