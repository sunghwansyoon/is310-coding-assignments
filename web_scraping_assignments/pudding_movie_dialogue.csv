Trouble in Paradise


Trouble in Paradise
 
			SEQUENCE A 

FADE IN  NIGHT
  
MED. SHOT   DOOR OF A HOUSE   
A cheap residential district. The house has no architectural 
character; it is not certain where we are. Near the entrance 
door is a garbage can, full.

A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage. We hear whistling, 
footsteps. A garbage man comes into the picture. He shoos 
the dog away. Without pause in whistling, he lifts the 
garbage can and, followed by camera, goes to the end of the 
block, which is only a few steps. Now we discover we are in 
Venice. In the background is a major canal and a typical 
bridge--romantic background. Gondolas are passing. In the 
foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola, piled 
high with garbage. The man dumps his load, leaves the empty 
can on the sidewalk, gets in the gondola, and paddles away 
with the grace of a gondolier. Now, in a beautiful tenor 
voice which is quite a contrast to the garbage, he starts 
singing a passionate "

large ocean liners which are being unloaded by arc light. In the B.G.

CLOSE ON a finely-worked Medieval tapestry.  In the
background, beyond the intricate foliage, stands a moated
castle where a troop of mounted hunters set out for the
chase with dogs and lances.  In the foreground, a lovely
young maiden heads for the forest, carrying an armful of
flowers.  The forest, stylistically rendered by the
weaver's art, has numbers of small animals cunningly
worked into the warp and woof.  A Green Man, clad only in
leaves and vines, hides behind a tree, watching a stately
pair of unicorns grazing on the greensward.

1. 	Exterior. A London square. Night.

   	But a shabby square. Wet and misty, creating a halo 
	around a street lamp - an old-fashioned, gas one, the 
	period is circa 1954/5. The mist partially obscures 
	the surroundings. Out of the mist emerges a man, 
	gaunt, raw-boned, in a soiled trenchcoat open over a 
	shabby, ill-fitting suit. His five o'clock shadow is 
	just showing. His thoughts are worlds away from his 
	surroundings. His age is indeterminate, anything from 
	mid-twenties to mid-forties.
   
	He is heading towards the row of shops on one side of 
	the square: fog hides the square itself but the 
	outlines of one or two trees are visible - the 
	diffused light from the street lamp illuminates some 
	leaves.

1	EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn.

On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all
North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.

Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.
Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,
depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.

     The beginning is identical to the movie, so we considered 
     useless reporting it here.  It's from Mathilda's first rifle 
     training scene that the original script is totally different 
     from the movie. This version is much more violent and the

OPEN on a highway road in a remote coastal town.  We see CAR HEADLIGHTS 
approach,
and we see it's a CONVERTIBLE with the top down, an old 60's sportscar, beat-up but
cool.  

The driver is JIM TRUDELL; he winds his way down the road.
He's in good shape, and carries the look of a man who has seen and done much in his
32 years.  

The road is desolate, except for a lone ROADHOUSE BAR up in the distance.  Jim sees
it and heads toward it -

Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

We're looking down at what used to be called ""The End of the Known

In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
over a cliff:

AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
the ice. A human figure. This is:

JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -

CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks

			EXT. BLACKSTONE AVE. - 2000 - NIGHT

            Dark night.  Most street lights shot out.  Just one or two of
            the eerie vapor lights left on the block.

            A MIDDLE-AGED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN carries his single bag of
            groceries.  The man listens and watches carefully, as he
            negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the
            street.

            We won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of
            light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear.

            Moving down the block, all shops abandoned.  Broken windows. 
            Rats.  The man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out
            and crumpled in an abandoned doorway.  It's the crackhead we

               After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen
               and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest
               this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is
               tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead
               man.

INT. KATS BEDROOM - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

The woman is KAT ELLIS, 30. Tears stream down her face as
she sits cross-legged amid the detritus of a packing frenzy.

There is an unfortunate green bridesmaids dress hanging on
the back of the door.

Kats pain is palpable. She buries her head in her lap.

Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS.

Kat sits bolt upright, wide eyed. She looks around in
disbelief. How did this happen? What is she doing on the
floor?

          A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.

          Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
