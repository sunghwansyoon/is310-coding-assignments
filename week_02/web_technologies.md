## Assignment 1: Inspecting the Web
I inspected UIUC Library, which used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. https://digital.library.illinois.edu/
Unfortunately, I couldn't access to the list of contributors.
I found a UIUCLibrary Github repository. https://github.com/UIUCLibrary
It seems like faculties of University of Illinois involved in this project.
In this repository, Python, PHP, Ruby, Groovy, and Powershell are used.
