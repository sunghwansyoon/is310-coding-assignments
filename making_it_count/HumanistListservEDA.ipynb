(e.g., note or mail) address to\\nhumanist at utoronto. your messag is then sent by your local\\nsoftwar to the utoronto node of bitnet, where the \"revis list\\nprocessor\" (or listserv) automat redirect it to everyone\\ncurr on the list of members.\\n \\nrestrict convers or asid can, of course, develop from\\nth unrestrict discuss on humanist by member communicating\\ndirectli with each other. thi is particularli recommend for\\nrepli to gener queries, so that humanist and it member are\\nnot burden with messag of interest onli to the person who\\nask the question. if, for example, one of us ask the rest\\nabout the avail of softwar for keep note in\\ndevanagari, suggest should be sent directli to the\\nquestioner\\' e-mail address, not to humanist.\\n \\npleas use your judgment

seems\\npreferable. thi is not to discourag controversi -- quit the\\ncontrari -- but onli what could becom tiresom junk-mail.\\n \\nnew member will be interest to know that listserv at utoronto\\nmaintain an archiv of messag for the past month. if you have\\njust join and want to know the recent histori of discussions,\\nent the follow command (or it equival on

mourn plaint about\\nth declin of typographi and edit ever sinc paperback novels\\ncost 50 cents.....  but it is clear that the phenomena observed\\nar real -- that is, standard of typographi and edit have declined,\\nth qualiti of mani print book is veri poor (i don\\'t mean the\\nqual of their content, but their \"product values\"!), etc --\\nhowev faulti the reason which lay thi all at the foot of dtp\\nmay be.\\n \\n  my perspect on thi is as someon veri much involv in\\na scholarli publish operation.  reed, where i\\'v worked\\non way or anoth sinc 1976, see it volum of edit texts\\nstraight through from transcript of mss to camera-readi final\\nproof in-house.  one of the reason is, of course, the need to\\nmaintain control over the scholarli qualiti of the edit and\\nit apparatus, but anoth chief reason is a deep concern over the\\nqual of the final book from the point of view of design and\\nproduction.  happily, thi concern is share by our publisher,\\nth univers of toronto press, and it design department.\\n \\n  but it seem to me that dtp is far from a forc work against\\nqu in product and design: until read thi articl it\\nwouldn\\'t have occur to me that someon could cast recent improve-\\n in computer-bas typeset and pseudo-typeset as the\\nvillain of the piece.  in fact, i\\'d alway thought that the great\\nadvantag of dtp for the scholarli commun is that it place the\\nabl to maintain that kind of control over both aspect of the\\nfin book, which we have been abl to enjoy at reed becaus we are\\na larg project with a major univers press behind us, within the\\ngrasp of most academ work on a univers campus.  i think that\\nmor and more univers comput centr and depart are likely\\nto make avail the equip and expertis need to allow\\nindividu editor of journal or author abl to control and\\nproduc their own work up at least the first proof stage, if they\\nwish.  sure the dtp can be use to revers a trend toward poor\\nqual in book production, rather than increas it, at least among\\nthos group to whom high-qual book product would be important.\\n \\n   i don\\'t realli think veri much of electron public for a lot\\nof reasons, and especi one which lou mentioned, and no-on else\\nr seem to have pick up in subsequ discussion, that is, that\\nit is access to such a small audienc of users/readers.  but using\\nelectron mean to improv the qualiti of convent scholarly\\npublish realli seem to me an excit possibility.  as the quality\\noutput devic like laser printer improve, it seem like that dtp\\nmay make scholarli book less expens to produce.\\n \\n  what do peopl think?  is anyon els interested?\\n \\nabigail ann young\\nyoung at utorepas\\n\\nfrom: john bradley \\nsubject: dtp discussion\\ndate: tue, 16 jun 87 11:33:10 edt\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 64 (64)\\n\\nabigail young\\' comment on dtp, and the effect on the qualiti of\\ntoday\\' public strike a respons chord in me -- dtp is\\nan area i have been look at quit close for some time.\\n \\ni think a certain amount of the neg comment in the toronto\\nglob and mail articl can be easili explained: the natur human\\ntrait to emphas the neg side of change.  of course, dtp\\nis, unfortunately, often use in such a way that it degrades\\nquality, and, indeed, such an articl can be use in that it\\npoint these problem out.  however, i think it is foolish to\\nonli look at the neg side.\\n \\nit seem to me that there are two reason whi dtp might reduce\\nth qualiti of output:\\n \\n(1) the technolog cannot do as good a job as traditional\\nmethods.\\n(2) the control over the technolog is put in the hand of people\\nwithout the requir skills.\\n \\nitem (1) is, i think, gradual fade as an issue.  for example,\\nit\\' true that laser printer output is not as good qualiti as a\\ntru typesetter, however, postscript typesett such as the\\nlinotron 100 or 300 also make it possibl to use dtp software\\nand equip to produc typeset qualiti images.  another\\npoint 2 is, i think, realli the central issue, and is like to\\nremain so.  realli good work in thi area cannot be done by\\namateurs.  in the interest of reduc costs, \"camera ready\" copy\\ni be produc by peopl without the abil to judg the\\nqual of what they are producing.  almost everi day i see\\npeopl who have no understand of what they can reasonably\\nexpect from softwar and hardware: for example, i still talk to\\nat least 1 person a week who is plan to produc camera ready\\ncopi for a book by connect a laser printer or our typesetter\\nto wordperfect.  each time i explain that wordperfect can drive\\nour postscript typesett or laser printer -- but doe far too\\ninadequ a job in mani way (for example, of hyphen and\\njustification) to meet the standard that one would expect for a\\nscholarli work.  clearly, the decis to use wordperfect for\\nthi purpos wa made by a person who is ill equip to decide!\\n \\ni guess the issu is one of education.  i believ that high\\nqual work can come out of dtp, and that dtp permit new\\npublish ventur to be consid and tried.  however, the\\nqual issu need to be better understood in the community.  at\\nu of t i am current attempt to put togeth a brief seminar\\nto introduc some of these issu to the univers community.\\nperhap thi type of thing is need at other

comput servic have supplied\\ntypeset facil to all british univers and polytechnics, as well as\\nto sever foreign universities.  we have a monotyp lasercomp for a typesetter,\\n(and we hope in the fairli near futur to have a postscript typesetter). all we\\nprovid are the facil (that is, the typesett itself and a front end\\nsystem in the form of a program call laserset, which somewhat simplifi the\\ncommand and doe syntax checking). each user typeset hi own document.  by now\\naround two hundr book have been typeset in thi way.  for the most part, the\\nstandard ha been high, although there have of cours been some notable\\nexceptions.  we alway strongli  advis user to go to their publish at the\\nearliest stage possible, and have the typographi depart of the publisher\\ndesign the book. when thi is possible, the book should look exactli as good as\\nani other book design by that publisher.\\n     problem arise, however, when the user doe not yet have a publisher, or\\nwhen the publish doe not have a typographi depart (this, unfortunately,\\ni becom more common).  our advic is then for the user to spend some time in\\nlibrari and bookshop look for a suitabl book whose format the user\\nadmires.  it is then quit easi to use thi as a model. we tri to stress the\\nimport of the look of the book, as it is easi with the lasercomp to achieve\\nhigh qualiti result if the design is good.\\n     it should be said that we are not engag in desktop publishing; more in\\ndo-it-yourself publishing.  our system is probabl at onc easier and more\\ndifficult to abuse.  we can achiev veri fine control over the look of a page;\\nfin than is possibl with most desk-top publish programs.  however, no\\nbas structur or design is impos or even suggested, and there is noth to\\nstop an innoc user from produc a horrend page.  on the whole, however,\\nour user have been quit conscienti and have made consider effort to\\nproduc text which have a pleas appearance.  perhap thi is in part because\\nour system is a bit more difficult to use than a real desk top publishing\\nsystem.  the user must learn \\'foreign\\' terms, such as pointsize, leading,\\nhang indents, kerning, film feed and set feeds, all of which remind him that\\nh is dabbl in an area of consider tradit and expertis and art, and\\nencourag him to walk with caution, possibl even respect. most of our users\\nseem to

campbel asks\\nwho want art graduat who know prolog, as oppos to those who have\\n\\'a \"compet user\" level of familiarity\\'. i disagre with scott on two\\npoints:\\n a) art graduat are no differ or wors than anyon else. ie they are\\nlik to go into the big bad world and work in a big business. and what will\\nthey use in the bbw? - spreadsheets, word-process and simpl database\\nqueri - henc the argument for teach use of sql, as it give a very\\nconveni upgrad path to a fuller understand of relat database\\ndesign, and map of the real world into that way of thinking. so to\\nthat extent, no program need be taught at all.\\n \\n b) i dont agre (pace philipp kahn) that \"prolog = ai = 5th generation\" ;\\non the one hand there are expert systems, and there is ai, which may find\\nprolog a suitabl vehicle; but on the other there are 5th gener languages\\n(of which prolog is a crude example) which mani peopl (supposedly) find\\neasi to use on a day to day basis. you can do anyth you like with prolog,\\nso it need not be seen as an either/or situation, with prolog or lisp being\\nseen as onli suitabl for expert systems, and icon seen as onli suitabl for\\nstr processing. all these comput languag are problem-solv notations,\\nwhich differ peopl may find more or less easier to use to solv their\\ngiven problem.\\n \\ni suppos the question is whether undergradu have problem to solve;\\nmi argument is the speciou and out-dat one that learn to solve\\nproblem with a formal notat is fun, interest and vagu useful.\\nther is a much stronger argument, though, that the student

problems, identifi and characterize\\nthem, understand their nature.  and then to determin which tool may be\\nappropri for the problem.\\n \\nin my experience, i find that undergradu (and some

of you who were member of thi group a week ago will recal that\\non of your colleagu went on holiday.  befor he left he ensur that\\nani messag that arriv in hi \\'comput mail box\\' were answer by\\nan automat program that inform the sender that he wa away.  to make\\na long stori short thi automat program got into an electron discussion\\nwith the humanist program at utoronto.  sinc all of you are privi to any\\nelectron convers that occur with humanist, you all receiv a ton\\nof electron mail.  sinc each piec of mail wa essenti the same, it\\nmad for some extraordinarili bore reading.  fortunately, willard wa able\\nto catch thi process befor the network wire began to melt under the load.\\n \\nthi morn i came in to work and found a complaint in mailbox from the u.k.\\nabout thi incident.  the person request that i ensur that thi situation\\nwould not be repeat in the futur for it wa inconveni and expensive\\nto those in the u.k. due to network charges.\\n \\nfirst of all, i have repli to the individu concern and i hope i have\\ndealt with hi concerns.  however, i thought that there may be more of you\\nwho were \\'silently\\' annoy by the incident.  so i felt that a full explanation\\ni probabl in order.  i discuss thi with willard and he agreed.\\n \\ni realiz that such an incid can be annoying, but the natur of the beast,\\n(computers) dictat that these \\'bugs\\' will occur from time to time and\\ncannot be predicted.  in thi case, a user on anoth comput instal a\\npiec of softwar that had, to say the least, a devast effect when it began\\nto \\'talk\\' with humanist.  the user involv is not under willard\\' control or\\nmine.  indeed, the user could have been anywher in the world.  willard and i\\nhav attempt to set up humanist in such a manner to be as use to all as\\nhumanli possible.  some of you may rememb that dartvax ran amok in a similar\\nfashion when the discuss group began.  that situat wa also rather\\nobscure.\\n \\nthe point is, comput loop will occur from time to time and some of them\\ncannot be predict or prevented.  i ask you all to react in a kindli manner.\\nsimpli smile, laugh, swear a bit maybe, delet the offend files, and carry\\non enjoy the benefit of humanist.  willard and i realiz that thi is a new\\nmedium for some of you and we will endeavour to provid thi servic with the\\nminimum of bother and confusion.\\n \\nto make humanist a use and an effici medium, i urg you all to keep\\nwillard and/or myself inform of your like and dislik of the service\\nprovided.  i believ the benefit to the academ world far outweigh the\\noccasion annoy of a comput bug.\\n \\nif you wish to express ani concern that may not be of interest to all members\\nof humanist, pleas feel free to contact me directli at:\\n \\n

at\\nvassar last year.  for thi reason i made slight revis in the call\\nwhich i hope broaden the scope somewhat.\\n  however, my impress at the vassar confer wa that more questions\\nwer rais than answered.  it may be true that the program issu has\\nbeen beaten to a pulp (although a recent re-hash of that issu on humanist\\nl me to believ that a lot of peopl had not yet heard it or felt it\\nresolv ssatisfactorily).  however, we have not answer such question as:\\nwhat exactli is it that we think that human student need to learn\\nabout computers?  skill only? or more about

(and we know\\nfrom thi list that some have even tri to bridg the two language\\nclass by teach icon, with, however, disappoint results.)  it is\\nsignificant, i think, that the former are often interest *primarily*\\nin enabl student to write program for their own use, often\\nteach advanc undergradu or graduat students, and take routine\\nscholarli inquiri as their context, while the latter tend to emphasize\\nth logic structur of comput programming, teach undergraduates,\\nand focu *primarily* on understand the machin as an end in itself\\nor to broaden horizons, rather than as a tool to help get quick and\\ndirti solutions.  i cannot think that thi debat is unrel to\\n\"teach human cours about what comput are and how they\\nimpact on human cultur and human nature.\"\\n \\na for cours that explicitli address the social and cultural\\nimpact of comput -- i agre they are important, but i don\\'t\\nse ani great shortag of them.  nor do i see -- and thi is\\nmi second point of confus -- how we expect to conduct useful\\ndiscuss of computers, what they are, and how they may affect\\nhuman natur and culture, without arrang to give at least some\\nof our student some concret knowledg of what happen in the\\ncpu.  mani social issu (privacy, organiz efficiency, and\\nso on) may well be address without ani program knowledge.\\ni daresay the sociologist are address them; i don\\'t see that\\nmi train in literatur call me to tri to address them, too.\\nand the interest question that do seem to belong in the\\nhumanists\\' bailiwick (computers-and-human-creativity, computers-\\nand-human-dignity, can-computers-ever-think, ...) seem to me to\\nrequir some knowledg both of comput and of the humanities.\\n \\nto take a simpl example:  weizenbaum\\' \\'eliza\\' program and its\\n\\'doctor\\' script can lead to far-rang discuss of profound\\nsoci and person issues.  but from the relev chapter in\\nweizenbaum\\' book we can see how catastroph the discuss can\\ngo awri when no one can understand a word the other are saying.\\nweizenbaum doe not seem to have understood what the psychoanalysts\\nwer talk about, and they clearli were incap of follow his\\nargu -- largely, i think, owe to their technic naivete.\\nthey could not see how the program worked, and he could not show them.\\n \\nani cours on the impact of comput on societi risk exactli the\\nsam difficulti if the student don\\'t have ani pragmat computing\\nskills.\\n \\n--- sinc i began thi note, there have been a number of further\\nexchang on thi issue, and i have acquir a third point of confusion:\\nwhy, if one prefer confer at which more question are raised\\nthan answered, should one complain in the first place that the same\\nissu are go to occupi the time of anoth conference, worri about\\n\"broken records\", and impli that no one els in comput spend any\\ntim worri about the same issu from one year to the next?\\n \\nperhap there were multipl version of the announcement, and\\ncanadian got a differ one, but i certainli do not see what\\nsterl beckwith is talk about when he say the oberlin\\nannounc wa not open to the issu he seem to want to\\nraise.  \"what should be includ in such courses?\" is explicitly\\nlist as a topic, as are \"directli related\" question and any\\n\"substant discuss of the issu surround the teach of\\ncours on comput and the humanities.\"  it would take casuistry\\nworthi of ignatiu loyola to say that thi call for papers\\nexclud the issu rais by sterl beckwith.\\n \\ni will note in close that joe raben deserv better

it is not of concern to us\\nwheth someon is a historian or nuclear physicist, onli that they\\nne advice.  clearli the fact that our advis are drawn from a\\nrang of disciplin benefit our users, though we are far from able\\nto satisfi everi custom due to a combin of limit knowledge\\nand limit resources.\\n \\nthe anti-human comput attitud which is found in some\\ncomput servic is an archaic

1 num. 155 (155)\\n\\n1 problem--two cultures?\\n \\ni am glad that roger hare mention snow\\' two cultur problem as the\\nbackground for the current discuss here in these electron page about\\ntechnolog (\"science\") vs. the human (should thi be in quot too?).\\nhowever, the problem that ha arisen with the advent of comput into the\\nhuman and other set of tradit non-comput user is different,\\nbut not new.\\n \\nsomeon mention hi \"old professor\" still struggl with hi typewriter.\\nher is a problem akin to the advent of the microwav oven as oppos to the\\nold technolog of radiant heat ovens, or the gas-barbecu as oppos to the\\nold technolog of charcoal barbecues.  some peopl just have difficulty\\nadapt to new tools; but the new tool just \"cook\"--they produc the same\\nproducts.  word processor are just better typewrit when they are use to\\nproduc paper and even electron essays.  in the end, we are consum what we\\nconsum prior to the new technology, but we are produc it quicker--and\\nperhap with less resourc (\\'person-years\\') required.\\n \\ni there anoth and also a new problem?  i believ so--and thi problem has\\nbeen the one that lurk in the shadows.  comput not onli replac certain\\nmethod of production, but also can be use to produc new entiti (products,\\ngoods, services, creatures).\\n \\n2 the problem of how to adjust to the new world of comput creations:\\n \\nthi problem cut across disciplin and professions.  corpor worker in\\ngovern and industri bureaucracies, teacher in educ organizations,\\nartists, homemakers, privat entrepreneurs... have thi problem of how to cope\\nwith the new products, new world, creat by computers.  thi new world is the\\nworld of softwar process that function quasi-intelligently.  for instance:\\nsoftwar account model that predict and analyz cost-benefit; computer\\ninstruct system that teach; comput graphic system that generate\\nanimations.  the differ here is that when the comput \"cooks\" we get a\\ndiffer type of product.  the product is the process--and the process is\\nsemi-autonomous.  onc set going, it ha requir which the user must\\nsatisfi if the user want to receiv the goods.\\n \\n   in everi technology, there is a process and product.  however, there is an\\naspect of some comput system where the products, or results, are in a sense\\nby-products, and where the process is the real product.  thi is akin to our\\ninteract with people, where the mode of interact is itself the product,\\nand the suppos goal of interact are in a sens by-products.  my point is\\nthat we are quit familiar with thi situat in our daili live when\\ninteract with peopl and other species.  we are quit familiar with\\nprocess such as teaching, discussing, playing...when in the compani of\\norgan such as peopl and pets.  however, undertak these similar form of\\ninteract with semi-autonom non-organ entiti is somewhat\\ndisconcerting.\\n \\n    in teach the student can switch class or the worker can quit, however,\\nth law and moral prohibit the student and worker from kill the teacher\\nor manag he dislikes.  however, the user can \"kill\" the instruct system,\\nor the account system--h can even, if he is the programmer--chang the\\n\"soul\" of the system.  so it seems.  unfortunately, there is a new ethic, with\\nenforc by law in some cases, kill or tamper with the softwar when\\non is not \"licenced\" to do so is forbidden.  it is not mere a matter of\\ncopywrit protection, but of maintain softwar integrity.\\n \\n  3  the new problem:\\n \\n     the new problem is:  how should we interact with semi-autonom computer\\nsystem that perform like people?  some comput develop and critics, such\\na winograd and the dreyfuss\\' in their recent books, do not want the problem\\nto even get off the ground becaus they want to shelv machin that perform\\nlik people.  but part of their hesit ha to do with the realiz that\\nth more we allow semi-autonom system to perform people-functions, such as\\nteaching, game-playing, art-making...th more respons and skill we give\\nto and give up to these systems. for instance, calculators, some teacher fear,\\ntak away elementari arithmet skill from children (and adults).  but why\\nworry?  will we give up more seriou think skill to comput systems--such\\na help student to diagnos their intellectu problems--onc we allow\\ncomput system to perform more of the function that we have done sole with\\nhuman resources?\\n \\n   recently, someon told me of an incid with one of the pioneer of logic\\nteach comput systems.  he introduc comput assist logic teaching\\nsystem into hi intro logic courses.  the final step wa that he allow the\\ncomput system to teach the entir course.  student onli came to see him\\neith if they were to advanc or to behind the comput system--which was\\nonli a small number.  the major were satisfi to work sole with the\\ncomputer.  however, the administr soon caught on to thi situat and\\nwond whi he need graduat assist for hi course.  so, the teacher in\\nord to save hi requir for assist retreat and return to only\\nallow the comput logic teach system to function as a supplementary\\nsystem.  of course, what he realli want wa to have more interact with the\\nmajor of students.\\n\\nfrom: willard mccarti \\nsubject: scientist and humanists\\ndate: 6 august 1987,

\\nw.m.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                        humanist so far:\\n               a review of the first two months\\n \\none of the first activ of the new special interest group for\\nhuman comput resourc ha been to establish an\\nintern electron discuss group, humanist, on the\\nbitnet/netnorth/earn node in toronto, canada. the purpos of\\nhumanist is to link togeth those who in ani way support\\ncomput in the human in the term defin by the new sig.\\niniti humanist wa focus on discov a common\\nprofession ident among it members; although thi remain a\\nstrong interest, it horizon have expand considerably.\\n \\nhumanist\\' first messag wa sent out on 13 may to approximately\\ntwo dozen peopl in three countries. as of the end of july,\\nhumanist ha grown to nearli 100 peopl in 9 countri around the\\nworld, and membership continu to grow. to be includ an\\nindividu must onli be involv in some way with the support of\\nhuman computing; he or she need not be a member of the ach\\nor allc, although membership in these organ is actively\\nencouraged. becaus we do not realli know what it means, this\\n\"support\" is in practic veri loos defined.\\n \\ntechnic speaking, humanist is a list of name and addresses\\nkept by listserv softwar on the ibm 4381 known as utoronto. when\\nlistserv receiv an ordinari e-mail messag address to\\nhumanist@utoronto by anyon on the list, it automat mail a\\ncopi to everi other person on the list. the sender need not be on\\nbitnet/netnorth/earn but can commun to humanist from any\\nnetwork with a gateway to bitnet. unlik conferenc systems,\\nlistserv doe not permit subdivis of a discuss group into\\nsubtopics. it is thu like a larg seminar on a veri general\\ntopic, in which everyon is privi to everyth everyon else\\nsays. de facto subdivis can be achiev by direct e-mail\\nconvers among members, but listserv doe noth to assist\\nthis.\\n \\neveri list ha one or more \"owners,\" who have supervisori rights\\nthat may be vari in their degre of control. humanist ha two:\\nstev younker, the \"postmaster\" of the utoronto node, who helps\\nwith problem relat to the network itself, and willard mccarty,\\nth editor. humanist ha been set up such that an individu must\\nask the editor to be given membership, but onc he or she is a\\nmemb mail privileg are unrestricted. the lack of control\\nin thi regard inevit lead to some unpleas flood of\\njunk-mail, but it also permit free-rang discuss and frees\\neveryon from the inhibit burden of dictatori power and\\nduties. the membership ha inde been patient and forgiv as\\nwel as veri live dure the initi period.\\n \\na few mutual respect rule of etiquett have evolved. direct\\nconvers among member interest in highli specialized\\ntop are encouraged, with the understand that the originator\\nof the special discuss will summar the result for everyone\\nelse. direct convers are especi recommend when a\\nhumanist ask for specif information, e.g., \"where can i find\\nworthwhil review of nota bene?\" member are also encourag to\\nidentifi the subject of contribut and themselv by name.\\n \\nbecaus someon appli for membership in humanist must say what\\nh or she doe to support comput in the humanities, the owner\\nha accumul mani interest biograph statements. these\\nwer recent gather together, cursorili edited, and sent out\\nto all humanist in order to introduc everyon to everyon else\\nand thu to help defin a profession identity. supplement are\\nplan as new members\\' statement accumulate. tim maher\\n(comput services, berkeley) is meanwhil work on a more\\ndetail and systemat questionnaire.\\n \\nin mani respect humanist fulfil the late marshal mcluhan\\'s\\nvis of the \"global village,\" in which the great physical\\ndist that separ it member almost ceas to matter. it is\\nfor that reason a fascin sociolog experiment. of course\\nhumanist is use to dissemin information, but the interaction\\nof personalities, perspectives, and idea bulk much larger in my\\ngrow file of contribut than exchang of facts.\\n \\n                      the discussions\\n \\nsinc the first contribut on 19 may, sever type of\\ndiscuss have occurred. i count 7 concern with the etiquette\\nof contribut to humanist, 8 request for specif information,\\nand one advertis of a job. on 5 occas it ha been used\\nto announc public of or offer subscript to both printed\\nand electron sourc of information, and 6 confer and\\ncal for paper have been publish thi way. interestingly, one\\nhumanist\\' object to the program for the forthcoming\\nconfer at oberlin -- he point to the repetit of issues\\nrais earlier at the vassar confer -- result in a thorough\\nexplor and defens of the rational for the conference. as\\non defend put it, the later confer return to the issues\\nof the first becaus both are deal with difficult and\\nimport questions: \"what it is we want our student to learn,\\nth natur of the world into which we are send them, and the\\nrelationship both of technolog and (more fundamentally) the\\nalgorithm approach to problem-solving.\"\\n \\n1. program in the curriculum.\\n \\nthe unresolv natur of these question is demonstr by the\\nprior and independ discuss on humanist about the teaching\\nof program to student in the humanities. some comments\\naddress the virtu and limit of specif languages, such\\na prolog or icon, or of languag of a specif generation. the\\nmor interest contributions, however, circl around the\\nquestion, \"whi should art student learn program at all?\"\\non humanist conclud that \"the more basic task is to teach\\nundergraduates, and peopl in general, how to recogn problems,\\nidentifi and character them, understand their nature, and then\\nto determin which tool may be appropri for the problem.\"\\nanoth note the analog with learn classic languages\\n(formerli the usual mean of acquir intellectu discipline)\\nand conclud by say that teach student a computational\\nlanguag will show them \"how to approach and analyz a problem\\nfrom a comput point of view. and that will help them both\\nin the big bad world... and in the academ world... where\\nhumanist need more than ever to understand how to express a\\nproblem clearli in comput term in order to get not just a\\ncorrect answer but the correct answer to the question they want\\nto ask.  it will also help them, if they remain in the academic\\nworld, to view with proper skeptic both those humanist who\\ndeni that the comput can be a valuabl tool... and those who\\nthink the comput can solv ani question it is worthwhil asking\\nbett than a human be can.\"\\n \\n2. profession recognit and electron publishing\\n \\nanoth substant discuss began with the vex problem of\\nprofession academ recognit for work in humanities\\ncomput and with the desir to exploit the electron medium\\nfor publication. the latter issu is relat to the former, since\\nelectron public carri with it no profession kudo and\\nmay preempt the convent kind. the latter, however, is in\\nsom case too slow to keep pace with develop in the field,\\nso that, for example, review of softwar may be obsolet by the\\ntim they see print. the formal of print may also inhibit as\\nwel as encourag higher standard of work.\\n \\nsome humanist comment that they would alway opt for\\npubl in print unless journal editor were agreeabl to\\npre-publ in electron form. unrestrict redistribution\\nwould be a problem, as would the avail and reliabl of\\nelectron network around the world. the lack of typographic\\nsophist as well as diacrit mark make imit of\\nprint journal impossible. \"the technolog isn\\'t up to it,\" one\\nperson said. anoth remarked, however, that sinc humanist is\\nnon-refereed, public there would be in a differ category\\nfrom the convent kind, somewhat like the circul of a\\ntechn report in comput science. the trick is to exploit\\nrath than be thwart by the characterist of the medium. a\\nchang in how research in the human is done could result.\\n \\nthe appear of thi column in the ach newslett repres a\\nlink with convent public and an attempt to exploit the\\nnew medium, but it doe not do much about the problem of\\nprofession credit.\\n \\nthere wa littl disagr about the lack of professional\\nrecognition. one humanist remarked, for example, that in his\\ndepart \"write softwar rank dead last in a list of 35\\nactiv consid worthi for english faculty.\" he went on to\\nnote, however, that \"i wa not hire to work with computers....\\nso, it is to some degre my own doing.\" he advis younger,\\nuntenur member \"to be sure that their comput activity\\noffici be made part of their job description,\" but he\\nconclud by note that most of the work in human computing\\ndo not itself constitut research, at least not in the\\nhumanities. thi is, of course, a seriou issue, sinc it raises\\nth question of our scholarli and academ legitimacy. it may be\\nsignific that there have been no repli to a direct question\\npos on humanist about our scholarli contribut to humanistic\\nscholarship.\\n \\none contributor had suggest earlier that work in humanities\\ncomput might be consid on a par with the edit of texts\\nor assembl of bibliographies, for example. the most vexing\\nproblem with make use of thi analog seem to point to the\\njuven of an emerg discipline: the lack of peer-review,\\nh of quality-control; the confus over aim and\\npossibilities; and indeed, the fluid natur of term and\\ndefinitions. the exchang over these issu on humanist have\\nbeen desultory, but the exist of an electron forum promises\\nto acceler the shape of thi new discipline.\\n \\n3. desktop publishing.\\n \\nhumanist also discuss the impact and potenti of desktop\\npublishing. the origin note the mani problem with formal\\nelectron public but remark that \"use electron means\\nto improv the qualiti of convent scholarli publishing\\nr seem to me an excit possibility.\" to the dire\\npredict of declin in qualiti she oppos the great advantage\\nfor the academ editor or scholarli research project of being\\nabl to control book product as well as to reduc it cost\\ngreatly. a respond note two reason for declin in quality:\\n(1) the typograph superior of tradit methods; and (2)\\nthe lack of requir skill characterist of most desktop\\npublishers. sinc improv in technolog will like soon\\nclos the gap between new and old methods, the second item is\\nreal the central problem. as he remarked, \"realli good work in\\nthi area cannot be done by amateurs,\" who are mostli unabl to\\njudg the qualiti of what they are producing.\\n \\nanoth humanist, who work at a major academ publish house,\\ndescrib a \"do-it-yourself\" (rather than desktop) facil that\\nto date ha produc over 200 scholarli volumes. she stress the\\nrol of the typograph depart of the press in help an\\nauthor design a volume; or, when the author doe not yet have a\\npress, of other book in provid model for him to follow. she\\nremark that \"on the whole... our user have been quite\\nconscienti and have made consider effort to produc texts\\nwhich have a pleas appearance.\" ironically, she note that the\\ngener high qualiti of these text may be in part attributable\\nto the fact that thi system is consider less \"friendly\" than\\nth usual desktop publish software. the user is forc to\\nlearn sever unfamiliar typograph terms, \"all of which\\nremind him that he is dabbl in an area of considerable\\ntradit and expertis and art, and encourag him to walk with\\ncaution, possibl even respect.\"\\n \\n                       conclusion\\n \\nwe plan to review the activ of humanist in the ach\\nnewslett on a regular basis. these review will also be\\npublish on humanist itself in order to remind the member what\\nha happen and thu to give them the opportun to renew a\\nlaps discussion.\\n \\nanyon wish to join humanist should send an e-mail note to\\nmccarty@utorepas.bitnet, give a brief profession biography.\\na i have mention above, these biographi will later be\\ncircul to all humanists.\\n \\nwillard mccarty\\ncentr for comput in the humanities\\nunivers of toronto\\n\\nfrom: s_richmond@utoroise\\nsubject: comput vs. humanity\\ndate:

onli differ from the\\nscienc in their notat systems.  if thi is the type of solut that\\nhar is proposing, there still  remain a dimens of snow\\' problem that is\\nuntouched.  veri few scientist and humanist can talk about each other\\' work\\ntogether--not onli on a profession level, but also on an inform level.\\nthey have veri littl comprehens of the problems, methods, and more of each\\nother.  thi is akin to a problem pose earlier by the founder of\\n\\'reconstructionism\\' in north american modern judaism.  m. kaplan ask -- how\\ncan the contemporari jew live as a jew in modern western civilization?  there\\nar two \\'civilizations\\' that the modern jew inhabits:  one is the traditional\\njewish civil steep in the bible, and rabbin interpret and law;\\nth other is modern western civil steep  in an extend version of the\\nbibl and in greco-roman more and values.  the literature, the mores, and the\\ninstitut of these two civilizations, not onli are differ but conflict in\\ncertain respects.  analogously, the modern humanist is educ in a\\ndistinct tradit with distinct more and problems; however, the\\nhumanist live in a world domin by the scientif culture.  how can the\\nhumanist live as a humanist in modern scientif civilization?\\n \\n2  are the two cultur becom one?\\n \\nperhap n. ide\\' obvers that textual analysi and literari critic is\\nconverg

problem that\\nal thinkers, scientists, philosophers, historians... are interest in:\\nnamely, what is our place in thi univers of random events?; and hi remark\\nthat what realli matter are pursuit of problem regardless of academic\\ndiscipline.  however, in spite of this, should we ignor the fact that the\\nfocu of the a.i. world and the literari critic world on the problem of\\nexplain how mean occur and how mean can be obtained, differs?  the\\na.i world is interest in simul the process of meaning.  the textual\\nanalysi world is interest in the mean of particular texts, of decoding\\ntext found in differ period of history.  isn\\'t thi one of the crucial\\ndiffer in valu between the scienc and humanities?  the scienc are\\ninterest in process just as process; the human

lead almost\\nimmedi to the more gener question of what humanistic\\nscholarship is, or what we think it is. popular cultur is still\\nperm with the simplist notion of progress, which in\\npractic is much more congeni to the sciences\\nthan it is to the humanities. a scientist\\' career\\noften hing on whether he is the first to announc a new\\ndiscovery, and if he doe the reward can be enormous. he is much\\nmor like to captur the public imagin than the humanist.\\n \\nthe humanist\\' discoveries, or rediscoveries, are both more\\nremot and more immedi to daili life, therefor harder to see:\\neith becaus cultur self-understand is difficult to\\nachiev and it effect profound and gradual, or becaus they\\ntouch intim aspect of life that are routin ignored\\nthough utterli inescapable. fruit of the scientist\\' work is\\noften marketable, at least in theory, wherea the humanist\\' work\\ni not. in an age domin by the \"ethic\" of the marketplace, it\\nfollow that the humanist is bound to do poorly. if forc to\\nsel himself, he will be forc to sell himself.\\n \\nnow i\\'m not say that scientist are crass and humanist noble\\n(i\\'d be absolut *overwhelmed* by evid to the contrary!),\\nbut that the public percept of their role creat a bad\\nsitu for the scholar of either kind. i\\'v heard scientists,\\ninclud our recent nobel prize winner john polanyi, complain\\nabout how highli tout work ha been conduct in spite of the\\ndemand of the marketplac and academ salesmen and about the\\nway in which direct of research have been disturbingly\\nalt by the pressur of grant

alway done, but do it more efficiently,\\ninde do it at all, is a disciplin worth following. as nancy\\nid ha said or implied, one import effect of humanities\\ncomput is to subject formerli intuit method to\\nalgorithm scrutiny, so to make consciou some of what ha been\\nsubconscious. i don\\'t think that mean our result will be either\\nless tent or less imaginative, but it doe mean that we may\\nknow ourselv as scholar better. the danger from within is that\\na champion of the observ phenomena from which algorithms\\nar construct we will lose sight of the unobserv and so\\ntrivi our disciplines. the danger from without is that like\\nesau we will sell our birthright for a bowl of yummi pottage. on\\nth other hand, the potenti of human comput both for\\nth human *and* for comput

us to do thing better  and  faster.    willard  goe on,\\n          though, to  point toward the more difficult problem when he says,\\n          at the end of  hi note,  that \"our  case is  somewhat different,\\n          sinc to  a much  greater extent  we must  also be interpreters.\"\\n          the question that ha to be addressed, it seems, is  how, to what\\n          extent, in what ways, can the technolog assist us in the task of\\n          interpretation?   in order to  answer that  question, we  need to\\n          begin  from  a  clear  idea  of  the  process  of

should be will either to keep the\\norigin of the machine-read version of the text inform of\\ncopi distributed, or to requir borrow to get prior permission\\nfrom the originator, at the originator\\' option.  (oxford doe this.)\\nthat way you can keep track of who is use the text, and if you have\\na suspici natur you can even quiz them on their motiv before\\ngiv permiss to borrow it.  you can also reserv the data for\\nyour own use for a while, until you have got your analysi well\\nunderway and don\\'t fear be \\'scooped\\' with your own data.\\n(person i think thi fear unrealist -- the number of people\\nin a posit to produc quick printabl result from a machine-readable\\ntext must be so small as to make the chanc negligible.  still, i\\nhav heard thi fear from sever people.)\\n \\n3 machine-read copi of text should be in a documented\\nencod scheme (ach is work on develop one of these, and\\ncom from interest parti may be address to the undersigned)\\nand includ in the file itself (so it\\' still there even after\\nth paper document is lost) the relev information:\\nwho wrote the text, it titl and date, bibliograph reference\\nto the edit use as copi text, who made the machine-readable\\nversion, where, and when.  archiv may wish to insert additionally\\ntheir name and ani revis or re-format they have done.\\n \\n4 when you use a machine-read text, both the origin of\\nth data and the distributor (eg a text archive) should be given\\ncredit in a footnote, just as you would give credit to the editor\\nand publish whose edit of shakespear you were using.\\nthi is establish practic in the social scienc (i am told),\\nand ha done a littl bit to make peopl will to publish their\\ndatasets.

a\\ncomput program that would be abl to gener the possibl word\\ndivis in a greek text.  sinc ancient greek wa written in a\\ncontinu script until about the ninth centuri a.d., the word divisions\\nin our critic text are base on later interpret editing.  i\\nshutt at the thought of what would be involv in program such a\\nthing.  then one day while i wa work with the tlg text i came up\\nwith an idea.  we at brown are use a system call isocr to access\\ntlg.  rather than search through the text themselves, isocr has\\nan index to each author and an index to the entir corpus.  isocrates\\nwa develop by greg crane at harvard in conjunct with the institute\\nfor research in scholarship at brown.  (of course, all due credit to dr.\\nbrunner).  my idea wa to gener a sequenc of string from a greek\\ntext and match each time to a file of greek words.  i have finally\\ncomplet a work version on the mainframe.  for the first version i\\'ve\\nus the word file to the septuagint (greek old testament) sinc it was\\nth easiest to get to in the isocr files.  here is a sampl of the\\noutput for galatian 1:6-8:\\n                             line 6\\n                             ______\\n   qauma qaumazw a ma a zw w o oti ti iou o ou outw outw w ws ta\\ntaxew a ew ew w  ws me met meta ta a ti tiqesq  qe qesq ea a\\nap apo pot potou o otou to tou o  ou ouk kale a esan sa san a ant\\nto o os su uma ma a as en xariti  a ar ti xristou to tou o ou ei\\nei eteron te ro o on eu a ge ion o on noo\\n                             line 7\\n                             ______\\n   o o ou ouk esti estin ti tina in ina a all allo o ei mh mhti h\\nti tine in esei  ei ei eisi eisin sin in o  oi ta tarassont a\\nar ara ara a as son o on ont te  su uma ma a as kai a ai qel-\\nont o on ont te me met meta metastreyai ta ta a as a ai to o\\neu a ge ion o on to tou o ou oux xristou to tou o ou\\n                             line 8\\n                             ______\\n   a all alla  a kai a ai aie ea  ean a anh nh h hmei  me ei eis\\nish sh sha h a aggelo ge elo o os ec o ou our oura ouran a o ou\\neu a ge zh h ta a ai umin in par a ar ro o eu h ge elisa isa sa a\\nm meq a umin in ina a ana anaq anaqema a qema ema ma a estw w\\n \\ni\\'m not sure how much explan is need or how much more i should\\ntell.  i\\'m not too optimist that i will discov ani place which\\ncould be divid up differently.  i would appreci ani comments,\\nsuggestions, questions, or criticisms.\\n                             tim seid\\n\\nfrom: cameron@exeter.ac.uk\\nsubject: call confer exeter\\ndate: wed, 09 sep 87 19:17:54 bst\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 297 (297)\\n\\nfor all humanist reader - accommod still avail if  requested\\n                                     immediately.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                 univers of exeter\\n                                   program structure\\n                                          and\\n                                      principles\\n                                          in\\n                                         call\\n                          lope hall, septemb 21 -23 1987.\\n                 cost 50 pound all inclus - pro rata rate available\\n \\n                                  monday septemb 21\\n       16.30 -\\n       18.00    registration\\n       18.00    reception\\n       19.00    dinner\\n       20.15    s.dodd (exeter) call and the chalkface.\\n                d.f.clarke, (u.e.a.) design consider in the product of\\n                extend comput assist read materials\\n                                 tuesday septemb 22\\n       08.00    breakfast\\n       09.30    p.hickman, (la ste union)  structur interact grammar\\n                practic programs.\\n                d.ferney, (wolverhampton poly.) a comput model of the french\\n                nativ speaker\\' skill with grammat gender.\\n       10.45    coffee\\n       11.15    o.durrani, (durham) design labyrinths: text maze for language\\n                learners.\\n                a.benwell, (lanchest poly.) how we use help facilities.\\n       13.00    lunch\\n       14.30    a.kukulska-hulme, (aston) liber or constraint : the useful-\\n                ness of a program interfac to a vocabulari database.\\n                g.a.inkster, (lancaster) databas as a learn activity.\\n       15.45    tea\\n       16.15    workshop : read program - d.f.clark (u.e.a.);

strong feel about\\nthis, it might be good to have a recommend policy. doing\\nsepar note may make it easier to organ what humanists\\nwish to keep. in ani event;\\n \\n1. brief inform on hardware, software, etc., would be\\nwelcom via humanist. for more elabor treatment, including\\nsometim the sourc code of programs, jack abercrombie\\'s\\nonlin note is an appropri list that goe out monthly\\nto 200 or so e-mail address (write jacka@penndrls). indeed,\\nfor inform purposes, the content of such onlin notes\\nand similar servic could perhap be list in humanist along\\nwith list of other relev e-mail sources.\\n \\n2. more generally, on the inform front, i would like response\\nfrom humanist on how to reach the non-e-mail multitud with what\\nthey need to know about comput relat developments. for several\\nyear i have publish a brief column (offline) in the main\\nprofession newslett for religi studies, and i suspect that\\noth profession societi organ may have similar column -- and\\nthat some profession group do not. it is clear to me that many\\ncolleagu want such inform and will not subscrib to the\\nspeci comput public (chum, scope, llc, etc.) or join the\\nassoci that produc the special publications. these colleagues\\ncan be reach most easili through their own profession publications.\\nbut much of the inform they need is not at all \"discipline\\nspecific\" so it occur to me that perhap we should encourage\\nth creation of a \"syndicated\" column approach that we could offer\\nto the variou profession societi and editor for inclusion\\nin newsletters, etc. it is one function that a consortium of\\nprofession societi might be interest in supporting. i would\\nb interest in be involved, if the idea seem feasibl and\\nif other would also get involved, with their own professional\\ngroup in view. responses?\\n \\n3. respond to joseph baumgarten\\' note, but with general\\ninformation. sever humanist have first hand acquaint with\\nth ibycu system, i suspect, and i certainli do. it would be\\nincorrect to describ the ibycu sc as capabl onli of accessing\\ncd-rom material. it is an excel all-around tool for scholarly,\\nand especi textual, work. it word process capabilities\\nar adequ and get better. it program languag (similar\\nto c) is rel transpar and powerful. mani program of\\nvari sort are avail in thi languag (ibyx), which has\\nbeen in

ibycu sc in the near future. an extensive\\nreview of the machin appear in the inaugur issu of\\njohn hughes\\' bit and byte review last october, and can be\\nxerox for anyon interested.\\n \\n4. for

that last statement to sound mercenary, but the manner in which\\nth system is use will in some way be driven by dollars, pounds, lira, etc.\\n \\ncan the cost be control by control chatter?  well, listserv are set\\nup to encourag disscuss on a broad basi among mani people.  willard is\\nyour editor and guid light in thi matter.  as editor he ha decided, after\\nconsult with the initi

up to you.  i believ the expression, \"free-wheeling\" is appropriate\\nhere.  if one or more peopl feel that submiss to the group are becoming\\na littl fuzzi or irrelevant, all that ha to be done is to send a gentl and\\n \\nwillard ha told me that in hi opinion, the group ha found it intended\\npurpos rather than stray from it.  in that, you are to be congratulated,\\nfor other listserv group have been known to turn into real zoos.\\n \\nso, if our friend down under are charg by the line, i guess i can encourage\\ny to be succinct in your submissions.  on the other hand, if they are\\ncharg by the number of \\'piec of mail\\' received, then such a suggest is\\nunnecessary.  mayb our new zealand friend can tell us how they are charged\\nand suggest some way of make it cheaper

edt\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 344 (344)\\n\\ndear colleagues:\\n \\nthi past weekend i had the opportun to talk about humanist\\nand relat matter with a small group at the annual conference\\nof the mediev associ of america, in cleveland, ohio. four\\nsess on comput in the human were held, of which time\\nallow me to attend three. the next to the last session wa given\\nentir by humanists: chuck henri (columbia), may katzen (leicester),\\nand john j. hugh (bit & byte review). i won\\'t attempt to\\nsummar what they said, but from their talks, as from the talking\\nof comput humanist everywhere, the need for the share of\\ninform becam veri clear. thi need wa address in the\\nfin session of the series.\\n \\nthi session began with the question of access to information\\nand the form it might take. sever particip (among whom i\\nwa one) stubbornli insist that the qualiti and reliabl of\\ninform and it mean of organ are more import than\\nmer quantity. the field is no longer so poor that we need\\ngrat snatch at whatev might be found; in fact, a\\nresearch can easili be overwhelm by the volum of raw\\ninform avail in mani area of human computing. we\\nar not yet able, however, to depend on accept convent of\\nquality, aim, and focus.\\n \\nwe gave some attent to standard for software. some\\nparticip note that these do not need to be spell out,\\nrath they should be analog to the implicit standard of\\ntradit academ disciplines. sever peopl complain of\\nth gener lack of agreement about what constitut good\\nsoftware, with the concomit undepend of software\\nreviews. these often do littl more than illumin the ignorance\\nof the reviewer. trust, one particip point out, is\\nessential; otherwis the reinvent of wheel is a lamentable\\nnecessity. the mla\\' project to provid peer-review of software,\\nwhich randi jone announc recent here, wa mention as one\\nposit sign.\\n \\nthe lack of academ recognit for work in our field (which\\ncontribut to the poor qualiti of reviews) natur rear its\\nblat ugliness, but one particip report that at his\\ninstitut a group of senior professor had been able, after\\ntireless efforts, to get such work to count toward hiring,\\ntenure, and promotion. there wa gener agreement that such\\nrecognit depend not onli on the unbend insist of\\nsenior faculti but also on the solid of the work and the\\ndepend of it mean of access.\\n \\nmay katzen point to the wider problem of access on various\\nlevels. expert can forget that comput or potentially\\ncomput humanist requir inform accord to their\\nexperi and interests. introductori guidebooks, textbooks, and\\ncours are thu as necessari as comprehens bibliographies.\\nagain, the worth of inform is not necessarili proportional\\nto it volum but depend on it structur and it reliability.\\n \\nexist and forthcom channel of commun were discussed:\\nmay katzen\\' humbul electron bulletin board and it parallel\\n\"human commun newsletter\" in the u.k.; john hughes\\'\\n\"bit and byte review\" and forthcom book, \"bits, bytes, &\\nbiblic studies: a resourc guid for the use of comput in\\nbibl and classic studies\" (forthcom novemb 20, 1987,\\nbi zondervan publish house); the \"human computing\\nyearbook\" that ian lancashir and i are involv with; our own\\nhumanist; and sever books, journals, newsletters, and other\\nelectron services.\\n \\nmay katzen later note that, \"we need differ kind of vehicles\\nfor convey differ kind of inform about comput in\\nth humanities, depend on the inform itself and the needs\\nand interest of user and readers.\"  i found myself noticing\\nthat what make humanist differ from the other (and i think\\nespeci valuable) is that it convers style encourages\\nnot so much the exchang of inform but of idea and\\nsubstant issues. as editor of humanist i usual tri to\\nstimul or provok discuss rather than contribut to them,\\nbut here i cannot resist offer my view that the discuss of\\nidea and issu is what we do best of all. thi is not to say\\nthat humanist should not be use for distribut listings,\\ntexts, reviews, and so forth, just that our prime possibl for\\ncontribut to our emerg disciplin seem to me more\\nphilosoph than informational. unless, that is, \"information\"\\ni interpret etymologically, to mean \"that which bestow form.\"\\nform is exactli what we need

in\\nansw to sebastian rahtz\\' inquiry.\\n \\njim noblett at cornel wa working, last i heard, on a system for\\nforeign-languag (specif french, but i think the system was\\nto be extensible) composit work.  the basic concept wa that of\\nan editor or word processor with the tool to make second-language\\ncomposit easier, specif onlin dictionari lookup in\\neith direction, and the abil to examin inflect paradigms\\non demand (to find out just what the second-person plural future\\nperfect subjunct form is).  there may have been standard\\ncomposit aids, too (outlining, screen-blank for brain-\\nstorm sessions, and so on), but i don\\'t believ there were when\\ni saw the program in 1986. a system for brow rather than composition\\nwould requir a different, but overlapping, set of features. perhaps\\nsomeon more with more recent knowledg can report on the program.\\n \\ncommercially, there is a system call mercury, for creat and\\nus onlin lexica.  thi is a memory-resid program for ibm pcs\\nand compatibles; the intend users, i believe, are primarili working\\ntransl (who would construct special lexica for technical\\nfields, to aid their work in technic translation) and language\\nteach and learner (who would use the onlin dictionari for\\nbrows text in the target language, or for composition).  i have\\nnot use mercuri myself, but the grapevin i\\'v heard ha been\\npositive.  one big advantage:  it\\' memori resid and so can be\\nconsult from whatev editor the user fanci -- the user is not\\nforc into a specif kind of editor to use the lexicon.\\n \\nsinc you ask for desiderata, i\\'ll suggest five:\\n(1) the user should be abl to brows through the dictionary\\nheadword (eg on a screen with one headword per line, and the\\nbegin of the dictionari articl on the rest of the line).\\n(2) the user should not have to type the word to be look up, if\\nit\\' alreadi on the screen:  posit the cursor over the word\\nin question should be enough.\\n(3) ideally, the user should be abl to find inflect form as\\nwel as dictionary-headword form -- at least for irregular inflections.\\n(4) (for thi the student should get seriou extra credit!) i\\nalway want to look up synonym and near-synonym of word i\\nam learn -- so it would be nice to be abl to get a display of\\nword with similar meanings.  a hidden lookup base on roget\\'s\\nthesauru number might be one approach to thi task, but maybe\\nyour student can come up with someth better.\\n(5) in read the text, the user should have the same freedom of\\nmov found in ani normal text editor:  forward and backward by\\nscreen or line.  thi seem obviou to me but there are serious\\nprogram for humanist which give you a forward-onli brows function,\\nand eventu they make me want to put my fist through the screen.\\n \\nfinally, i want to argu that a truli seriou program of thi kind\\n(not necessarili a student project, or a program one write for\\noneself and one\\' friends, but certainli a program written for\\nwid seriou distribution, whether commerci or not) would do very\\nwel to handl text in format other than plan vanilla ascii.\\non can alway export a wordstar or word perfect file to ascii,\\nand ditto for most other program -- but it\\' a boring, burdensome\\nchor and it would be a real boon to have text-analysi tools\\nb abl to handl one\\' word processor file without further ado.\\nideally, the analysi program would recogn bold and underscoring\\nand centering, and display accordingli -- fail that, i\\'d settle\\nfor a program that just strip out the control code and\\ndisplay legibl text.  would it be so imposs to handl files\\nin the five or six most common word processors?  from my experiences\\ndeciph word perfect files, i\\'d say not imposs at all.\\n \\ndo other peopl agree, or would thi be ask too much of our\\nsoftware-mak friends?

to compil a bibliographi of\\nsoviet studi on \"ceram epigraphy\" and amphora studi in\\ngener (which, of course, get us into the odd excavation\\nreport, for date and stratigraphy, and even into clay analysis\\nstudi of other objects, like roof-tiles; and we aren\\'t above\\noblig with a curs tablet article, when requested).  when\\nenough materi is available, i would like to offer the\\nbibliographi (which would list avail \"private\" translations,\\non line or off) to other humanists, and send on-lin translations\\nto anyon who asks.  if i want to publish a volum of\\ntranslations, i or the publish firm would, i think, get\\npermiss from the origin publishers: is electronic\\npubl different?  or is it simpli the lack of formal\\nlegisl cover the comput journal

\\nsure one could argu that a text, even one in copyright, keyboarded\\nfor research purpos into a singl comput and access onli to\\nth originator, would fall under the scope of \\'fair use\\'.  if i

(if they say\\nno, what have you lost?  you can alway say \\'articl x is\\nunavail for copyright reasons.\\')\\n \\nwe should hammer and hammer at our publish and ourselv and\\ncolleagues, though, until we achiev wide public accept of\\nunhind distribut of electron text for research purposes.\\nno pirating, no intellectu theft, full document of the\\nsourc of both the origin and the electron form -- get that\\naccept as the basic code of practice, and i think we\\'ll be\\nmak progress.\\n \\nmichael sperberg-mcqueen, univ. of illinoi at chicago\\n\\nfrom: norman zacour             923 9483 \\nsubject: \\ndate: 24 octob 1987, 22:25:53 edt\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 386 (386)\\n\\nthe follow ha 32 lines.  subject: copyright.\\ni doubt veri much that make a copi of someon else\\' work to be\\ndistribut to friend and colleagu can be defin as `fair use\\'\\neith legal or morally. to duplic a copyright work instead of\\nbuy it is to deni the author\\' rights;

tent which seem to me\\nto be appar about the use of cd-rom for distribut and\\nus larg text-bases.  publish seem a) reluct to enter the\\nmarketplac with refer materi on cd-rom, becaus they\\nfelt (base on market research) that there wa not a large\\nenough demand (except perhap among institut users, such as\\ngov\\'t depart or univers libraries);\\nb) curiou about what effect the new ibm worm drive would have;\\nc) worri about the need to provid new softwar and new format for\\ndata to make it realli useabl in electron form (that is, publishers\\nseem veri awar that electron publish a book is not so\\nsimpl as to write the text on a cd-rom and sell it -- that seems\\nto have been one idea which emerg strongli from both the publishers\\'\\nand the users\\' point of view dure work on the new oed).\\n \\nand the users\\' commun (or at least that part of it represented\\nin waterloo) seem to be a bit ambivalent: they want cd-roms\\nbecaus they could be use on micro\\' rather than mainframes, and\\nbecaus they offer secur and perman which mag tape\\ndoesn\\'t have.  but they want the textbas on those cd-rom to be\\nstructur differ from the text in the publish reference\\nworks, and they want softwar base on the new structur to\\nb provid for inform retrieval, etc, and they expected\\nth cd-rom to be cheap:  they didn\\'t seem to want to hear from\\nth publish that that latter goal wa disconson with the\\nfirst two, unless there wa a huge demand for the finished\\nproduct.\\n \\none former publish sum it up rather well by say that\\nwhat the industri (publishing) wa wait for wa an electronic\\nbest-seller, someth with a broad enough appeal to individual\\nus to caus them to go out and buy cd-rom reader and whose\\nparticular use and access wa enhanc by the\\nelectron medium in a way that no convent medium could\\napproach.\\n \\ni wa veri interest by all this, and i think i\\'v summarized\\nfairli the kind of attitud be expressed.  mani

\\nsecond point. some time ago we agre that answer to specif questions\\nask on humanist should be sent to the question directly, not to\\nhumanist, and that the question would then gather up the

said:\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n  i understand the motiv for thi editori approach, but i\\n  would like to point out that share iter refin of a\\n  question is typic both of group conferencing, includ face-\\n  to-fac interact as well as telephoni and most bulletin\\n  boards.  for example, i just discov a bug in the microsoft\\n  quickc compiler.  the typic respons of particip in the\\n  microsoft confer (on bix) is to suggest solutions, often in\\n  the framework of \"have you tri x\".  these respons could be\\n  mail to me instead of be post in the conference, but\\n  they have public value.  often, these \"responsive\" questions\\n  contain error that neither the origin \"speaker\" nor the\\n  respond can correct.  or, even if the origin \"speaker\" can\\n  correct them, it take the voic of the multitud to convince.\\n \\n  in addition, some of the most product respons can be the\\n  most trivial in content, as variou particip temporarily\\n  take up the burden of moderating. \"say more.\"  \"what do you\\n  mean by this?\"  it may be littl more than assur that\\n  other are interest and listening, confirm that the\\n  origin posting, which may have been in larg part test the\\n  water anyway---that the origin post wa appropri and\\n  that the author should let out the stops....\\n \\n  i have been particip in electron confer for three\\n  or four year now, includ bix, compuserve, and variou bul-\\n  letin board around the country.  in my judgment, the current\\n  approach threaten to stifl discourse.  in order for brief\\n  splinter discuss to form, everyon who might be interested\\n  would have to contact the origin poster and request to be\\n  ad to an ad hoc list, which may have valu for no more than\\n  a few day and a few mail anyway.  also, can we realisti-\\n  calli expect everi humanist to be prepar to take on the role\\n  of moder and list server for a few days?  the face-to-face\\n  analogue, i guess, would be the act of a few peopl stepping\\n  asid to hash out someth that the group find uninteresting.\\n  or, might it just as well be the perk up of a few ear to\\n  see if anyth interest is be said? or to see if one has\\n  anyth to add to the convers that seem to be develop-\\n  ing?  how is thi dynam to occur if one immedi shunts\\n  asid all of the convers shit work (a some feminists\\n  have so aptli put it)?\\n \\n  our goal, i believe, is, in part, to share inform and, in\\n  part, to find out what inform none of us have---to\\n  identifi area that need research or question that one of us\\n  might be abl to answer in a coupl of months. even such rela-\\n  tive pure inform motives, however, cannot be well served\\n  by restrict group commun to the obvious

(there are pc-base 9-track\\ntap drives, but they aren\\'t real common.)  and mani humanist don\\'t\\nlik work on mainframes.  even for those users, however, the\\nloc academ comput center should be, and almost alway is,\\nin a posit to read the tape and help the user download the data\\nto a microcomputer.  no, it\\' not alway easy.  and no, it\\' not\\nalway fast.  a megabyt an hour or so.  but the chanc are good\\nth academ comput center know how to do it, and doe it regularly.\\nal the one i\\'v ever known as a user or staff member do.\\n \\nthere may be center that do not provid thi kind of service,\\nalthough i have never seen one and never heard of one.  but if\\nthey exist, those center should be driven to provid support\\nfor human computing, support for microcomputing, and support\\nfor data exchang between mainfram and micros.  if they are not\\nprovid these services, they are not do their job.\\n \\ngiven the kind of support comput center ought to be providing\\nfor

479 (479)\\n\\nthe recent observ by abigail young and michael\\nsperberg-mcqueen on cd-rom and worm technolog call for\\nsom comment from the \"pro\" (and experienced) side. i hope\\nto keep them brief, just to pinpoint some of the issues.\\nmichael\\' comment seem to me to miss mani crucial points,\\nand did not reflect the attitud or situat of numerous\\npeopl with whom i am in regular contact.\\n \\n1. the differ between cd-rom and worm for thi discussion\\ni negligible, as abigail suspected. right now, worm drives\\nar more expens and less test publicly, but cheaper to\\nproduc a singl disk. but onc you have that singl worm disk,\\nwhich current cost about $65, there is no price advantage\\nto make multipl copi (50 copi would cost $3250). with\\nth cd-rom, it might cost $3000 to master but each additional\\ncopi would cost veri littl (perhap $ 7 each for 100). thus\\nit would be much cheaper to make 100 copi of a cd-rom than\\n100 copi of a worm disk at present. and the cd-rom holds\\nmor than twice as much as the worm disk with which we are\\nworking. so worm is fine for limit product or in-house\\npurposes, cd-rom is better for larger distribution, etc.\\nneith can be chang onc they are mastered, although\\nworm can be master in stages, while cd-rom is a onc for all\\nmast process.\\n \\n2. are peopl anxious wait for data distribut on cd-rom?\\nin my experience, yes. we have mani advanc order for the ccat\\ncd-rom, and more inquiries. ted brunner can report on the tlg\\nexperience. what sort of peopl are asking? obviously, ibycu sc\\nowner (about 130 machines) who are set up to use cd-rom as part of\\nth package; librarians, who need massiv amount of data in a\\nbibliograph control context (static is good, in this\\nsetting!); the mass of individu scholars/stud who are not\\nin a tape-ori environ such as michael describ (his\\nexperi is not at all typical, even at the ideal level, of\\nth major of peopl with whom i am in contact -- peopl in\\nsmal colleges, seminaries, or oper individually, with\\nno access to a real mainfram or effect consultation).\\n \\n3. what is attract to these inquirers? sever fairli obvious\\nthings. (1) amount of materi avail -- e.g. all of greek\\nliteratur through the 6th centuri on the tlg disk! (2) price\\nof the materi (on tape, the tlg data cost over $4000; on\\ncd-rom, it is about 10% of that) (3) conveni of storage,\\naccess, etc. -- i would rather download from a cd-rom than\\nfrom a tape drive, ani day. it is the old roll vs codex issue\\nonc again (microfilm vs microfiche, etc.). (4) qualiti control --\\nwhat is on the cd-rom may have errors, but at least they can be\\nidentifi and control (and correct in a later release);\\ni don\\'t have to wonder whether my dynam file ha become\\ncorrupt (a happen more than i want to admit). (5) speed of\\naccess to larg bodi of data -- even if the program are not\\nyet in place and it will take 20 time as long to search a\\nlarg cd-rom file on the ibm than on ibycus, it is at least\\nposs to do the search (or to search multipl files, in\\nvari configurations), which is extrem difficult in any\\noth manner short of a dedic mini.\\n \\ni am rambl and apologize. much more need to be said, but i\\nne to finish prepar id tabl for the ccat cd-rom if it is\\nto be master by the end of the year! perhap it would not be\\nfeas econom to put the nibelungenli on it own\\ncd-rom, but to have it as a small part of a cd-rom with all sorts\\nof other text is what we are talk about! that is not only\\nfeasible, but it seem to me highli desirable, ibycu or not.\\nand i can still download what i want to edit, or manipulate, etc.\\ni lose none of that capability. but i gain by have the original\\nfix at hand for comparison, etc.\\n \\nlibrari will rapidli be cd-rom centered, and that is as it ought\\nto be. hope comput center will not be bypass by this\\nexcit and use development!\\n \\nbob kraft\\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: summari of respons on kjv

assyriologist friend in the uk) is that\\nknudtzon\\' edit of the el-amarna letter is in machine-readable\\nformat.  i have use the massiv print \"concordances\" (two tomes, each\\nabout 7 inch thick).  these printout origin at ucla, so the best\\nbet is to contact giorgio buccellati at the depart of near eastern\\nstudies, who might make tape or diskett available.   ucla ha a\\ngrow corpu of mrt materi for the ancient near east, and in time it\\nwil be avail public as part of buccellati\\' hypermedia project\\nfor mesopotamia (computer-aid analysi of mesopotamian materials);\\nsom materi are current avail from undena, and buccellati\\npass out sampl diskett of digit eblait text at aos.\\n \\nthe sad tale i mention earlier is as follows: du cerf (a paris\\npublisher) recent releas a superb volum in it seri litteratures\\nancienn du proche-ori on the el-amarna letters.  its\\nauthor/transl is william moran of harvard university, recogn as\\na (probabl the) lead amarna scholar, who ha been put together\\nthi polish volum over the past 30-odd years.  hi translat are\\nbas upon extens museum collat of the tablets, togeth with\\nrestor that can be made onli by someon so familiar with the\\n\"idioms\" of intern diplomaci (in the 14th centuri b.c.e) as\\nprofessor moran is.  so, the mrt\\nedit we *really* want is moran\\'s, not the 1915 edit of knudtzon.\\nbut you won\\'t find it publish on diskett with thi du cerf volume\\n(which doe not even have transliter origin text).  accord to\\nth publishers, it would not be cost-effect to publish the original\\ntext on paper, and as for a mrt edit of the text....well...\\n \\nshortsighted like thi ha to stop, but who is respons for\\n\"stop it?\"  a singl individu (a in thi case, moran) probably\\ncan do veri littl to forc publish to chang their ways.  but how\\nabout collect bargaining....w publish such scholarli materi only\\nwith publish that are sensit about the futur of scholarship, and\\nabout the preciou treasur we have in ancient literature.  thi means\\nplac premium valu on origin text in machine-read form -- only\\nthu are they truli use and access to modern scholarship -- and\\nmak these text avail in the public domain.  i suspect that this\\nproblem is more acut for orientalist than for classicist and other\\nhumanities-literari subspecialti areas; we have special orthographies\\nand print problem which are expens and demanding.  but my\\nsuggest is that we must encourag and demand higher standard of\\ncooper from publish such that valuabl (priceless!) human\\neffort are not lost on a macintosh diskett after it pass from the\\ndepartment secretari or word-process pool to the publisher.  does\\nanyon els share thi point of view?  am i too idealistic?\\n \\nwhile i am in a lament mode, i might as well refer to anoth problem\\nthat need attention: the problem of code standards.  there are\\nsever effort underway intern to \"encode\" ancient near\\neastern text in transliteration\\n(toronto - rim; ucla; rome; helsinki; etc), but to my knowledg there\\nar no agreed-upon standards.  in the case of pure alphabet scripts,\\nth problem is frustrat but not fatal, sinc we can use\\nconsistent-chang program to standard the data for archiving.  in\\nth case of syllab (logographic; heiroglyphic) script -- akkadian,\\nsumerian, hittite, elamite, egyptian -- the plethora of transliteration\\nschem is more problematic.  no-on send thi kind of data with an\\nsgml prologue, so the best we can hope is that the encod is\\nconsist and that we can unravel the format codes.  if anyon knows\\nabout effort to introduc standard for transliter and\\nformat-coding, would you kindli let me know?  i understand that the\\ncommitte for encod standard (nanci ide; michael

markup must be descriptive.\\n \\n2) delimit should be \\'<\\' and \\'>\\' in conform with the default of the\\n   new smgl standard.\\n \\n3) markup/tag attribut should be allowed, and attribut name should be\\n   descriptive.\\n \\n4) there should be no attempt at establish a \"closed\" tag set.  the current\\n   aap sgml applic allow for definit of new tags, but it doe not\\n   support such definit in a practic way.  the consequ is that people\\n   will use \"list items,\" for example, when they should be use \"line of\\n   poetry.\"  within these guidelines, it can onli be healthi to provid a\\n   list of tag that peopl should choos from when tag certain entities.\\n \\n   the point of thi is that we cannot predict what textual element will be\\n   of signific for what researchers.  we have to allow for the discovery\\n   of textual element that no one ha categor previously.  at the same\\n   time, there is no point in have 30 differ tag for \"line of poetry.\"\\n   the guidelin should make clear that descript is paramount and that\\n   the use of particular tag is secondary.\\n \\n5) in so far as possible, there should be requir for minim tagging.\\n   it would be a mistak to fail to tag \"vers paragraphs\" and \"book\" in\\n   *paradis lost*, for example, and ani version that doe not provid such\\n   tag must be consid inadequ and, ultimately, rejected.\\n \\n6) there can be no limit place on \"maximal\" tagging.  if a research needs\\n   everi word tagged, we must allow for this.  it is a trivial matter to\\n   ignor or strip out such tagging.  research with such need cannot,\\n   at least for now, reason expect that other will provid such\\n   exhaust tagging.\\n \\n   put (5) and (6) together, we have a principl of base-level tagging\\n   with as much addit inform as the origin research care to\\n   provide.  where there are common need that may not be share by the\\n   origin researcher, it may still be appropri to requir that those\\n   common need be met.  for example, the origin research may not need\\n   to know about vers paragraphs, but we should still requir that they be\\n   appropri tagged.\\n \\n7) referenti markup should be use in place of \"special\" characters, such\\n   as accent characters.  if a particular configur support an acute\\n   accent, for example, in hardware, the research may take advantag of\\n   those facilities.  when check the document into an archiv or passing\\n   it on to others, however, the acut accent must be translat to\\n   \"á\" (or whatev the sgml standard specifies---don\\'t have my copy\\n   at hand).\\n \\n \\nthi is off the top of my head, but enough for now.  i have other idea on\\nthi stuff, but they can come out if discuss ensues.  i am interest in\\nth project, but i don\\'t have the time or money to travel to meet right\\nnow.\\n \\ni also get the feel from the preliminari document that you post that\\npeopl are re-inv sgml.  we alreadi have, in sgml, a metalanguag for\\ngener descript markup languages.  i don\\'t think that we need document\\ntyp definit right now, but even they might turn out to be use once\\nsgml is establish and sgml-support tool becom widespread.\\n \\ni haven\\'t provid ani defens of descript markup or sgml here.  we discuss\\nth advantag of these system in \"markup system and the futur of scholarly\\ntext

of what it make sens to encod regardless of\\nhow the text is origin intend to be used.  i should point out here that\\namong particip in the poughkeepsi meeting, there were two clear\\nperspect on

the \"minimum\" tag we might expect.  he made all of the\\nexcel argument for insist that certain tag be includ *anytime* a tex\\ni encoded.  but the problem here is that i am not sure who the \"we\"

the exist version is piti done. but most of the time it will be\\neasi to go in and mark whatev i need to mark in the exist version than to\\nre-ent the text entirely.\\n \\nsimilarly, we cannot expect archiv to ensur that their text contain a\\nminimum tag set.  thi wa a point of consider concern to the keeper of\\narch present at the meeting, and led to the final agreement that onli the\\ntag that are present (whatev they may be) in a text that is distribut by an\\narch will conform to the standard.  thi requir in itself will\\nnecessit the write of program to perform tranlsat to

those thing that are easili encod when the sourc text\\ni at hand and which are also obvious of use in most type of analysis.\\nhowever, it doe not appear to me that it is reason to requir such

(507)\\n\\ncontribut by \"jame h. coombs\" \\n[in repli to nanci ide\\' point about sgml and relat matters. the\\ninset paragraph quot from her messages. -- ed.]\\n \\n         we have everi expect that the standard we devis will be\\n         an applic of sgml, but until we know fulli our need it\\n         is not prudent to commit ourselv to sgml.\\n \\na minor philosoph point, i guess: i don\\'t think that we can know our needs\\nfully.  we need standard that accommod need that cannot be predicted\\ntoday.  the practic consequ of thi observation, which i\\'m sure nancy\\nwould agre with, is that one should seek a \"productive\" system instead of\\na system that satisfi everyth on a list, and one should not spend a lot\\nof time develop the list.\\n \\n         we know, for instance, that while it is possibl to define\\n         multipl parallel hierarchi in sgml it is not entirely\\n         straightforward, and such parallel hierarchi are like to be\\n         use extens in encod machine-read text intended\\n         for literary, linguistic, and histor analysis.\\n \\nwhat are \"multipl parallel hierarchies\"?  i can guess, but i want to be sure\\nthat i understand the problem.  in a most documents, we have, for example,\\npragmat and syntact hierarchies.  one ha no difficulti mark up\\ndocu for both at the same time (although one doe not normal mark\\nup the latter descriptively).  pragmatically, we have thing like\\n \\n  [         [         [         ] [         ] ] ]\\n   chapter   section   paragraph   paragraph\\n \\nsyntactically, we might have\\n \\n  [  [  ] [   [  ] ] ]\\n   s  np   vp  np\\n \\nso far as i know, there are no difficulti in mark up both type of\\nhierarchies.  one could argu that we realli have a singl hierarchi here,\\nbut, conceptu at least, we have two differ domains: pragmat and\\nsyntax.  well, thi distinct is bound to be controversial, to say the\\nleast!  thi is probabl the wrong list for a discuss about syntax vs.\\npragmatics, etc.  i can tri other examples, but i\\'m still guessing.  and i\\'m\\nstil wonder what the difficulti is in encod them under sgml.\\n \\n         however, our goal is to provid a meta-languag in which *all*\\n         exist mark-up scheme can be describ (which may prove to\\n         be impossible), and it seem to us that the abstract syntax of\\n         sgml is inadequ for thi task.\\n \\nwhat is the practic valu of a metalanguag that gener all markup\\nlanguages?  i would think that it would be so abstract as to be of no\\nvalue.\\n \\ni suspect that thi is part of the goal of salvag work that ha been\\ninadequ coded.  i believ that we will be better off if we worry\\nless about the past and plan more for the future.  i suppos that it\\'s\\ntru that publish have typeset tape in their basements, and that\\nw could use those tapes.  i think that we have to accept that those\\ntap are of littl valu until someon convert the code to\\ndescript markup.  i have the typeset tape for the american\\nheritag dictionari (sorry, can\\'t distribut it); no one wast time\\ntri to figur out how to use that tape as it is now.  i know of\\nsever project that are base on that tape, and all required\\nconversions.  ideally, the tape would have been convert onc and for\\nal (and it appar ha been now).\\n \\nwhether it\\' a dictionari or a literari text, we can expect that\\ninadequ code will caus consider work for anyon attempt to\\nus the database.  a metalanguag that includ procedur markup as\\nwel as descript markup will not help in such a case, becaus one\\nstil ha to map procedur markup onto descript markup in order to\\nb abl to work with meaning entiti (definition, paragraph, etc.).\\nsinc procedur markup tend to be perform somewhat arbitrarili and\\ndo not normal provid a one-to-on relationship between entiti and\\nmarkup, there is no metalanguag that will help a research perform the\\nnecessari conversions.\\n \\nwhat we realli need is a sensibl and dynam standard.  i don\\'t think\\nthat anyon would argu that that standard should be anyth other than\\ndescript based.  sinc we are go to have to convert text to\\ndescript markup in order to use them anyway, whi not just develop the\\nstandard and convert as necessary.  tri to save the past is just\\ngo to retard development.\\n \\ni haven\\'t mention sgml so far.  is there a problem with sgml?  i have\\nheard complaints, and we address them in our article.  no one expects\\nindividu scholar to master the full syntax and to gener document\\ntyp definit (dtd).  what we want is accur and consistent\\ndescript markup.  in our experi at brown, peopl have no\\ndifficulti master the principl of descript markup.  we can\\nleav the develop of dtd to experts.\\n \\n--jim\\n \\n

fallen a littl out of sequence, but the idea are more important\\nthan the sequenc anyway.  i have also heard from michael sperberg-mcqueen,\\nand i hope that he will post hi veri inform note as well.  if this\\ndiscuss becom aggrav for the major of humanist and there is\\nenough interest, then perhap we can form a separ mail list.\\n \\nso, here is my (unedited) repli to the issu of requirements.\\n \\n         while we may not be abl to requir that peopl conform to a\\n         standard fully, we can refus to accept inadequ texts.\\n         there is an atmosopher of poverti now such that we are\\n         anxiou to have whatev we can get our hand on.  at the\\n         extreme, even now most of us would reject a text that is all\\n         in upper case and contain errors---it turn out to be easier\\n         to do it oneself.  if we consid what thing will be like or\\n         could be like in a few year though, i think it\\' appropriate\\n         to say that there are certain minim standard (or one must\\n         compli with with a standard).  first, we don\\'t accept just\\n         anyth for other scholarli documents.  second, we will have\\n         more altern for sources.  third, we want high quality\\n         sourc so that peopl won\\'t have to keep rework or\\n         entir redoing.  if i can\\'t count on a text from a particular\\n         archiv to meet my needs, what is my motiv for bothering\\n         with that archive; and what is the motiv for the\\n         archive\\' existence?  i certainli would not want to see it\\n         support by public funds.\\n \\n         i don\\'t think that thi place an inordin burden on\\n         individu researchers.  for the most part, i\\'m sure that it\\'s\\n         consider less burdensom than ensur that one\\'s\\n         bibliography, for example, accord with the mla style sheet\\n         (and what bibliographi unambigu does?).\\n \\n         --jim\\n \\ni should elabor briefly.  first, i have/had a tape of milton\\'s\\n*paradis lost*; it wa so bad that i would prefer to start from\\nscratch.  second, i think that we have a right to expect archiv to set\\nand maintain certain standards.  perhap they don\\'t want to accept that\\nrespons right now.  if not, then i think that we should be\\nplan to develop and support a good archive.  doe such an archive\\nne sever programm for text valid and maintenance?  then they\\nshould have the support to hire them.  let\\' central the expens as\\nmuch as possible.  currently, we have no idea who is enter what and\\nhow they are do it.  even if we could get peopl to go to the archive,\\nth current approach mean that mani peopl are go to have to\\nmassag text into use formats, and everi project will have to ensure\\nthat the text is accurate.  it\\' as if we all had to revis our copies\\nof *paradis lost* and then go proof read them befor we could use them.\\nfinally, i have text that i have entered, mark up, and proof read, but\\ni\\'m reluct to check them into an archiv that is inconsist at best.\\nwhatev profession credit i might get for the contribution---well, let\\'s\\nsay that the effort is somewhat discredit by the state of the archive.\\nit\\' like publish a book with xyz press instead of abc.  i would be happy\\nto send it off to someon who provid full servic and valid text,\\nand i would be happi to make ani necessari corrections.  to revers the\\nroles, i am reluct to acquir a text from an archiv that make no\\nguarantees.  after all, in the process of keyboard a text, i get to read\\nit, and the time goe quickly.  it\\' the proofread that is burdensome, and\\ni still have to proofread.  (or do i get to say that i use x\\' text, and x\\ni go to accept the respons for errors.)\\n \\n--jim\\n \\ndr. jame h. coombs\\nsoftwar engineer, research\\ninstitut for research in inform and scholarship (iris)\\nbrown university\\njazbo@brownvm.bitnet\\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: acl appli natur languag confer (833 lines)\\ndate: 6 decemb 1987, 17:24:17 est\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 509 (509)\\n\\nthe follow is republish from irlist, the inform retrieval\\nlist. -- ed.]\\n \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nthe print version of the follow program and registr information\\nwil be mail to acl member earli in december.  other are encouraged\\nto use the attach form or write for a booklet to the follow address:\\ndr. d.e. walker (acl), 445 south street - mre 2a379, morristown, nj 07960,\\nusa, or to walker@flash.bellcore.com, specifi \"acl applied\" on the\\nsubject line.\\n \\n                             association\\n                                 for\\n                      comput linguistics\\n \\n       second confer on appli natur languag processing\\n \\n                         9 - 12 februari 1988\\n \\n          austin marriott at the capitol, austin, texas, usa\\n                           advanc program\\n \\n                              features:\\n               six introductori and advanc tutorials\\n            three day of paper on the  state-of-the-art\\n                   distinguish luncheon speakers\\n                     a panel of industri leaders\\n                     exhibit and demonstrations\\n \\n \\nregistr : 7:30am - 3:00pm, tuesday, 9 february,\\n  joe c. thompson confer center, univers of texa at austin, 26th\\n  and red river.\\n \\nexhibit :  10:00am - 6:00pm, wednesday, 10 february\\n \\n \\n \\n                           gener sessions\\n        wednesday, februari 10, 1988\\n \\n        session 1: systems\\n \\n        session 2: generation\\n \\n        session 3: syntax and semantics\\n \\n        session 4: morpholog and the lexicon\\n \\n \\n        thursday, februari 11, 1988\\n \\n        session 5: systems\\n \\n        session 6: text processing\\n \\n        session 7: machin translation\\n \\n \\n        friday, februari 12, 1988\\n \\n        session 8: systems\\n \\n        session 9: morpholog and the lexicon\\n \\n        session 10: syntax and semantics\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nregistr inform and directions\\n \\npreregistr must be receiv by 25 january; after that date, please\\nwait to regist at the confer itself.  complet the attached\\n``appl for registration\\'\\' and send it with a check payabl to\\nassoci for comput linguist or acl to donald e. walker\\n(acl), bell commun research, 445 south street mre 2a379,\\nmorristown, nj 07960, usa; (201) 829-4312; walker@flash.bellcore.com;\\nucbvax!bellcore!walker.  if a registr is cancel befor 25\\njanuary, the registr fee, less  $15 for administr costs, will\\nb returned.  full confer registr will also receiv lunch on\\nth 10th and 11th.   registr includ one copi of the proceedings,\\navail at the conference.  copi of the proceed at $20 for\\nmemb ($30 for nonmembers) may be order on the registr form or\\nbi mail prepaid from walker.\\n \\ntutori : attend is limited.  preregistr is encouraged\\nto ensur a place and the avail of syllabu materials.\\n \\nrecept : the microelectron and comput technolog corporation\\n(mcc) will host a recept for the confer at it site on\\nwednesday evening.  to aid in plan we ask that you complet the\\nrsvp on the registr form.  in addit there will be receptions\\nat the confer hotel on tuesday even and thursday afternoon.\\n \\nexhibit and demonstr : facil for exhibit and system\\ndemonstr will be available.  person wish to arrang an\\nexhibit or present a demonstr should contact kent wittenburg,\\nmcc, 3500 w. balcon center drive, austin, tx 78759; (512)338-3626;\\nwittenburg@mcc.com as soon as possible.\\n \\nhotel reserv : reserv at the austin marriott at the\\ncapitol must be made use the hotel reserv form includ with\\nthi flyer.  reserv subject to guest room avail for\\nreserv receiv after 25 januari 1988.  pleas mail to:\\n        austin marriott at the capitol\\nair transport : american airlin offer confere a special 35%\\noff full coach fare, 30% off full y fare for passeng origin in\\ncanada, or 5% off ani publish roundtrip airfar applic to and\\nfrom austin.  call toll free 1-800-433-1790 and give the conference\\'s\\nstar number s81816.  if you normal use the servic of a travel agent,\\npleas have them make your reserv through thi number.\\n \\ndirect : there is one public exit from robert mueller airport in\\naustin; at the traffic light, turn right (onto manor rd.) and drive to\\nairport blvd.

topic for a more extend private\\ndiscuss between those with an interest in text encoding\\nstandards.)\\n \\na nanci alreadi noted, sgml is the most like model which will be\\nus for the human text standard, howev there wa considerable\\nconcern at the meet by the french deleg about the workshop\\nendors sgml as the offici standard to be emulated.  in view of\\nthat, it wa deem essenti to avoid specif say thi in\\nfavor of the broader statement that we\\'d attempt to be compatible\\nwith applic exist standard where possible. specifically,\\nthi also includ charact transliter standards--which are a\\nconsider part of a human text standard\\' encod problems.\\n(i can hardli wait for iso to adopt an offici standard for encoding\\negyptian hieroglyph in ascii!)\\n \\ni would also howev like to make a strong statement that from a\\ncomput perspect there is no need for ani one format to be\\nth onli one used. what is need is that ani format must be fully\\ndocu and an information-preserv transform of the\\ncont of ani approv standard format.  thi wa captur in the\\nstat that the standard would be an `interchange\\' format.\\n \\nthi doe beg the issu of how the transform take place, i.e.\\na program need to be written or capabl of be run on the `other\\'\\nformat and on hardwar avail to the recipi of the data, but it\\ni import to note that an sgml-like format may appear as very\\nformid to user who believ they will have to type in all the\\nspeci code manually--wherea a `keyboarding\\' format may be just as\\nfaith in repres the inform without undo burden to the\\ntypist. i\\'m sure you will agre to thi sinc your excel cacm\\narticl note that one of the most overlook form of markup is the\\nus of tradit english punctuat and space conventions.\\n \\nreturn to your message\\' points, your 4th point seem to  me to be\\nexcept good and someth that we did not explicitli get to in\\nth poughkeepsi meeting, i.e.,\\n \\n``4) there should be no attempt at establish a \"closed\" tag set. the\\n current aap sgml applic allow for definit of new tags, but\\n it doe not support such definit in a practic way. the\\n consequ is that peopl will use \"list items,\" for example, when\\n they should be use \"line of poetry.\" within these guidelines, it\\n can onli be healthi to provid a list of tag that peopl should\\n choos from when tag certain entities.\\n \\n the point of thi is that we cannot predict what textual elements\\n will be of signific for what researchers. we have to allow for\\n the discoveri of textual element that no one ha categorized\\n previously. at the same time, there is no point in have 30\\n differ tag for \"line of poetry.\" the guidelin should make\\n clear that descript is paramount and that the use of particular\\n tag is secondary.\\'\\'\\n \\n \\ni think the mean by which thi latter goal, of not have 30\\nequival tag for the same text element, is to be handl will be an\\nimport role of the text encod standard subcommittees.\\n \\nwhat it strike me are need here are the databas concept of a\\n`data dictionary\\' to provid definit for all the `tags\\' and the\\ninformation-sci concept of a tangl hierarch thesauru of\\ntag (terms) includ the 4 major categori of `broader tag\\' (bt),\\n`narrow tag\\' (nt), `relat tag\\' (rt) and `use instead\\' (xt ?) type\\nof pointers. thu the standard subcommitte should begin work on a\\nthesauru of tag which defin each tag\\' intend domain of text\\nentities, it relationship to other more gener and more specific\\ntag as well as relat tag and tag which should be use instead of\\na given tag.\\n \\nthi means, for example, that in tag a text feature, one could\\nus a gener tag such as `paragraph\\' or a more specif tag such as\\n`summ paragraph\\' and that an author would have a guidebook of\\nestablish possibl tag that would tell them the option and what\\nqualif a text object had to have in order to qualifi for the\\nus of such a tag.\\n \\ni do think it is import to allow for arbitrarili deep extensions\\nof the tagging, but ani standard will have fail if everi author has\\nto resort to invent their own tag to encod text.\\n \\nnote, thi is still independ of the issu of `requir minimum\\ntags\\' in that the dictionari and thesauru of tag onli tell the user\\nhow a tag should be use and what altern exist to it use--they\\ndo not say that a tag must (or must not) be use (except in the case\\nof the `use instead\\' pointer that attempt to avoid tag be used\\nambiguously). my model of what such a thesauru should look like is\\nth eric thesauru of descriptors.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nrobert a. amsler\\nbellcore\\n435 south st., morristown, nj 07960\\n(201) 829-4278\\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: the

should seek a \"productive\" system instead of a  system that satisfies\\n   everyth  on  a  list,  and  one  should  not  spend a  lot of time\\n   develop the list.\\'\\'\\n \\nonc upon a time i wa

the problem  of the  select of  tag for text\\nent in documents.  that is, if the system is complet open and\\n`productive\\'  there  will  be  littl  common  between  author\\'s\\nselections--wherea  if  the  author  are  offer  a  wide-rang of\\napprov  tag to  select from,  then they  will manag  to find tags\\nwhich meet their needs.\\n \\n-------\\n \\n ``what are \"multipl parallel

possibl to have\\na work with tag which end insid the span of other still running\\nopen tags, e.g.,\\n \\n  ...  ... <\\\\line>\\n ... <\\\\foreign-word> ... <\\\\sentence> <\\\\line>\\n \\nthe problem here is that some entiti would be broken into two parts\\nif ani entiti were extracted.\\n \\n ``what is the practic valu of a metalanguag that gener all markup\\n   languages?  i would think

rather than requir every\\nsuch work to be recod in a new format, it wa hope that the new format\\ncould accept the exist work as is. whether that is possibl or not,\\na nanci stated, is an open

ordinarili  don\\'t get  the tape from\\nth printer and if they did would onli get the last  version on tape\\nbefor the final manual  cut-and-past corrections.   publish thus\\nroutin ignor and discard thi phototypeset data  as a useless\\nintermedi step  and save  the `valuable\\'  print plate instead.\\non reason is there is no common format in which to save the data for\\nreuse.  each printer ha their own variant of the hardware/software.\\n \\nhowever, regardless of that, the next is veri true.\\n \\n ``i think that we have to accept that those  tape are  of littl value\\n   until someon convert the code to descript markup.\\n                ....\\n   whether  it\\' a  dictionari or  a literari  text, we  can expect that\\n   inadequ code will caus consider work  for anyon attempting\\n   to use the database.  a metalanguag that  includ procedur markup\\n   as well as descript markup will not help  in such  a case, because\\n   one still  ha to  map procedur  markup onto  descript markup in\\n   order  to  be  abl  to  work  with  meaning entiti (definition,\\n   paragraph,  etc.).    sinc procedur  markup tend  to be performed\\n   somewhat  arbitrarili  and  doe  not  normal  provid a one-to-one\\n   relationship between entiti and markup, there is no metalanguag that\\n   will help a research perform the necessari conversions.\\n \\nyou are mix two thing here. first, while it is true one cannot go\\nfrom a typeset tape to a descript markup in one step, it\\ndoesn\\'t necessarili follow that the procedur markup is useless. a\\ncas in point is dictionaries. there is no descript markup\\nstandard for dictionari entri (i\\'m work on develop one with\\na number of other comput lexicologists, but none exist right\\nnow), yet the phototypeset tape of dictionari are veri useful\\nto creat a descript markup of their contents. headword are\\ntypeset in boldface, possibl outdented, certainli start new\\nlines; part of speech are in italic, pronunci are in special\\nfont for their phonet characters, usual enclos in (,)\\' or\\nsimilar delimiters. etymolog prefer [,]\\'s. label are in italics,\\nsens number in boldface, definit text in roman type, with\\nexampl sometim offset in <,>\\' and sometim in italics. all of\\nthes are posit context-sensit within the dictionari entry.\\ntheir descript natur can usual be unambigu determined\\nfrom the posit and font inform on a phototypeset tape.\\n \\nit would be a genuin aid to the peopl who today decod such\\nphototypeset tape if they were in onli one procedur markup\\nlanguage. at present they are in innumer mani differ markup\\nlanguages.\\n \\n ``what we  realli need  is a  sensibl and  dynam standard.   i don\\'t\\n   think that anyon would argu that  that standard  should be anything\\n   other  than  descript  based.    sinc we  are go  to have to\\n   convert text to descript markup in order to use  them anyway, why\\n   not just develop the

(obvious it also must be possibl to support the needs\\nof independ scholars.  but arrang to that end must not allow\\nschool to reap the benefit of have a center while evad the\\ncost of support it.)\\n    the motiv to join must, i think, be partli altruistic, partly\\nfinancial.  by join such a consortium a school can help support\\nhuman research in general, and get an aw lot of data free.\\nnot joining, then, must mean the data cost money.  it is not hard to\\nfigur that a consortium membership can be far cheaper than acquiring\\na scanner, pay mainten on it, and run it within the\\nschool.  join must also be prefer to buy the data from the\\nconsortium.\\n \\n  6 a center like thi could support text-encod standard in ways\\ni think oxford would find difficult.  without some deep chang in\\nit funding, the oxford archiv can\\'t hope to convert it hold to\\na new standard.  a new center could make that part of it raison\\nd\\'etre.\\n \\n  7 obviously, there is no need to limit the membership of a consortium\\nsuch as i have just describ to north america.  but i think that\\'s\\nwher the need is, research in europ be organ on different\\nlines.\\n \\n  8 thi concept of a consortium-support general-purpos archive\\nand center contrast sharpli with that of cooper among humanities\\ncomput center and with that of a set of region or discipline-based\\ncenters, which have been propound in recent year from some quarters.\\ni hope those who prefer those plan to thi will be persuad to\\ndescrib to use how they would prefer to see thing organized.  that\\nwould be extrem use to us all.\\n \\nmichael sperberg-mcqueen, univers of illinoi at chicago\\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: in repli to robert amsler on ach text markup\\ndate: 8 decemb 1987, 10:11:52 est\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 518 (518)\\n\\ncontribut by \"jame h. coombs\" \\n \\nrobert says:\\n \\n         i would also howev like to make a strong statement that from a\\n         comput perspect there is no need for ani one format\\n         to be the onli one used.  what is need is that ani format\\n         must be fulli document and an information-preserving\\n         transform of the content of ani approv standard format.\\n         thi wa captur in the statement that the standard would be\\n         an `interchange\\' format.\\n \\nfirst, i am confus by the word \"format.\"  i would like to see\\nsometh more specific, such as \"markup language.\"  perhap ach does\\nintend someth broader than markup languag though.  i need a\\ndefinit to know that i know what is be refer to.  doe \"format\"\\nher includ thing like the locat of markup?  microsoft word, i am\\ntold, store markup at the end of the file.  well, that seem to me on\\nfurth thought to be a markup languag with someth like a postfix\\nsyntax.\\n \\nwhile it\\' true that we can process file with a varieti of markup\\nlanguages, we need more than full documentation.  we have full\\ndocument of the procedur markup languag for waterloo script, for\\nexample, but that markup languag doe not provid us with the\\ninform that we need; instead of tell research that an entity\\ni a \"vers paragraph\", it tell waterloo script what procedur to\\nperform at a particular point in the text stream.\\n \\nperhap \"inform preserving\" is intend to captur thi notion\\nsomewhat.  well, the inform must be encod in the text in the\\nfirst instanc befor we can preserv it, and we want research to\\nencod the inform when they enter the text.\\n \\nan \"interchang format\"?  again, i\\'m a littl confused, or i\\'m not\\nconvinc that primari need are be addressed.  we have standard for\\ndocu interchang that preserv noth but format information,\\ne.g., font changes. if the primari instanc of a text encod nothing\\nmor than format information, then we will have information\\npreservation, but the inform that we preserv will not be the\\ninform that we realli need.  we will know how to print a text, but\\nw won\\'t know (computationally) what the individu entiti are.\\n \\ni imagin that robert and other agre with everyth that i have said.\\nwhat i am ask for is more precis and, abov all, a commit to\\ndescript markup.  in addition, i am ask for some restrict on\\nth markup languages.  specifically, markup should be contigu with the\\nel that are be mark up; markup should appear in the text\\nstream.  yes, we can process file that store all of the (electronic)\\nmarkup at the begin or at the end, or part here and part there.  but\\nwhi should we invit thi complexity?  can we reason expect every\\nscholar to have access to programm who can convert mani format into\\none?  or can we reason expect everi scholar to have a separate\\nconcord program, a separ retriev program, etc., for every\\nposs markup langauge? or for everi markup languag that is use in\\non of the text that the scholar needs?\\n \\nwhile it may be conveni in the short term for someon to sit down and\\ntyp in microsoft word, our accept of word document would be very\\nexpens to mani peopl for mani years.  what is the valu of a standard\\nthat allow this?\\n \\n         it is import to note that an sgml-like format may appear as\\n         veri formid to user who believ they will have to type in\\n         all the special code manually--wherea a `keyboarding\\' format\\n         may be just as faith in repres the inform without\\n         undo burden to the typist.  i\\'m sure you will agre to this\\n         sinc your excel cacm articl note that one of the most\\n         overlook form of markup is the use of tradit english\\n         punctuat and space conventions.\\n \\nif sgml appear formid to people, let\\' educ them, and let\\'s\\ndevelop softwar that minim the effort.  current popular software\\nseem to minim markup effort, but it fail to record sufficient\\nmarkup.  unawar of the defici of their software, peopl say that\\nthey want more fonts, for example, and that they are not interest in\\ndescript markup.  we need to make it clear to microsoft, dragonfly,\\nand other that we need descript markup.\\n \\ni think that we want to stay away from the word \"keyboarding.\"  one of\\nth complaint ha been that peopl do not want to \"keyboard\" markup.\\nso, if we use \"keyboarding\" for the act of perform scribal markup\\n(punctu and presentational) but not for the act of typing\\ndescript (and referential) markup, then we invit confusion.\\n \\nclearli robert is refer to the use of punctuation, and he must also\\nb refer to the use of present markup (e.g., skip space\\nbetween paragraphs).  both of these form of markup have deficiencies\\nthat descript (and referential) markup do not have.  abov all, they\\nar ambiguous; in addition, they are often much harder to parse.\\n \\nfirst, ambiguity.  period are use to end sentenc and they are use to\\nind that a string of charact is an abbrevi (mr.).  perhaps\\neven worse, the same charact is use to indic that a word is\\npossess and to indic the end of an imbed quotation, e.g.:\\n \\n  a) she told him, \"do not say \\'dogs\\' house\\' anymore.\"\\n \\nhow much time do we want to wast on develop algorithm to pars this\\nmarkup?  whi not use (b) instead?\\n \\n  b) she told him, do not say dogs\\' hous anymore.\\n \\nsoftwar can easili display (a) when it ha record (b), but it cannot\\neasili gener (b) when it ha record (a).\\n \\nof cours it is easier for most of us to enter (a) than it is to enter\\n(b); it is alway easier to do half the job.  onc we start accepting\\nthi responsibility, we will start convinc softwar develop to\\nsupport our needs, and enter (b) will not requir much more than\\nent (a) doe now.\\n \\nwhi would anyon want to record (b)?  well, they might want to print the\\ntext with open and close quotat marks.  they might want to studi all\\nof the quotations, or all of the imbed quotations.  they might want to\\nstudi the use of possessives.  and so on.\\n \\nsimilar problem occur with present markup.  yes, if we have a\\none-to-on map between present markup and text element, then\\npresent markup record all of the inform that descriptive\\nmarkup does.  we don\\'t realli need tag for each line of poetri in\\n*paradis lost*, for example.  we need know onli that each line of poetry\\ni termin with \\'\\\\n\\', for example.  there is no conflict with sgml\\nhere, however, sinc sgml support thi method of mark up texts.  in\\nfact, in such a case we don\\'t realli have present markup at all,\\nw have descript markup; the markup serv not to enhanc the\\npresent but to identifi that a stream of text is a line of poetry.\\n \\nyou also load thing a littl with the phrase \"undu burden,\" robert.  in\\npart, i am argu that there is a \"due burden\" that scholar must accept\\nif we are to get anywher in thi whole project of use comput to\\nassist our scholarship directly.  part of that \"due burden\" is the proper\\nencod of texts.\\n \\nin addition, i think that you over emphas the cost of entering\\ndescript markup.  you do so partial by implic that\\npresent markup is easier to select and perform.  we argu in our\\narticl that present markup is consider harder to select, and\\nthat there is no pretheoret motiv for believ that either\\nform of markup is easier to perform than the other.  in addition, you\\nseem to classifi markup as present whenev it doe not consist\\nof tags.  under our function definit of descript markup, at\\nleast, the markup that you are talk about is actual descriptive\\nmarkup.  in ani case, the sort of markup that you are talk about is\\nprovid for under the sgml standard.\\n \\ni thank you for your kind word on our article.  our next articl will\\nhelp clarifi the distinct that we make and how we are make them.\\nfor the present, it seem more import to make peopl awar of the\\nadvantag of descript markup.\\n \\ni hope that my respons doe not seem overli microscopic.  i find again\\nand again that conceptu confus lead to unnecessari practical\\nproblems.  in order for scholar to decid what form of markup to use,\\nthey must know clearli what the compet form of markup are and what\\neach form ha to offer.\\n \\nfinally, your discuss of thesauri and tag set is interesting.  i\\'m\\nnot sure that i have anyth to add to it.  need to think about it more.\\n \\ncheers!\\n \\n--jim\\n \\ndr. jame h. coombs\\nsoftwar engineer, research\\ninstitut for research in inform and scholarship (iris)\\nbrown university\\njazbo@brownvm.bitnet\\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: archiv polit (50 lines)\\ndate: 8 decemb 1987, 10:18:46 est\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 519 (519)\\n\\ncontribut by lou burnard  \\n \\n[thi messag wa delay as a result of finger troubl on my part - i\\nsent it to the wrong node - lb]\\n \\n        \" if i can\\'t count on a text from a particular\\n         archiv to meet my needs, what is my motiv for bothering\\n         with that archive; and what is the motiv for the\\n         archive\\' existence?

for that reason the standard will be extensible--and we hope to\\nmak user-defin extens far easier to deal with than aap does. but as bob\\namsl point out, a standard which specifi so littl that most researchers\\nend up invent their own tag anyway is not of much use.  bob also mentioned\\nthat our subcommitte are go to have to work close togeth to avoid\\nredund and to make note of place where altern descriptions, relat to\\ndiffer applications, describ what may be physic the same\\nthing--someth jim wa concern about.  i think bob\\' idea of a \"data\\ndictionary\" is excel and i hope we can implement it in the cours of\\ndevelopment.\\n \\n(2) by \"multipl parallel hierarchies\" i mean someth along the line of what\\njim outlined--except that hi exampl all use nice nest entities.  the\\nproblem aris when we have overlap entities, for example,\\n \\n   the  dog  ran \\n \\nwhere \"\" and \"\" mark the begin and end of a noun phrase,\\nrespectively, and \"\" and \"\" mark the begin and end of another\\nentity--say, a themat unit of some kind.  the context-fre syntax of sgml\\ncannot handl this, and so special mechan are requir to enabl multiple\\ntag set in which overlap entiti may be specified.  as i mentioned, these\\nexist in sgml but are not entir straightforward, from my understanding.\\n \\n(3) the ultim goal of an attempt to develop some formal descript of\\nexist scheme is to facilit the develop of translat program to\\ntransl old format into the new one.  i sympath with jim\\' feel that we\\nshouldn\\'t spend so much time convert the past, but i also understand, after\\nspend 48 hour with the keeper of the european and middle-eastern archives\\nwhich hous million of word of machine-read text, that it is not possible\\nto mount thi effort without consid what to do about text that already\\nexist in machine-read form.  i should also point out that at the end of the\\ntwo-day meet in poughkeepsi we had a discuss about establish a north\\namerican archive, but by that time mani particp had left and those who\\nremain had littl energi left to address the issu vigorously.  howev i\\nunderstood those who spoke to say that they didn\\'t feel the need to establish\\nsuch an archive, and that in ani case the oxford model (where no guarante of\\nqual are made) is sufficient.  i person tend to agre with jim that an\\narchive--north american or better yet, international--should be establish in\\nwhich text are \"guaranteed,\" and which more importantli serv as a central\\nclearinghouse.  oxford doe thi as well as it can now but without considerably\\nmor fund cannot more vigor pursu the acquisit and creation of\\nmachine-read text nor ensur that they are both correct and tag in a\\nstandard form.\\n

and not burden archiv with worri about\\nanyth more elaborate.\\n \\nmi own work with machin readabl text is limit to various\\nmateri in the thesauru lingua graeca text base; my own\\nnot of minim accept code and entri format stem\\nfrom thi experience.  without paus too much for the\\nrational in each case, i would extract the follow lessons:\\n \\n1. preserv of inform about page break and line end in\\nth origin text is not worth the effort.\\n \\n2. it is particularli bad if one preserv that inform at\\nth cost of retain soft hyphen in the text which are of no\\nsemant signific but a mere product of the typesetter\\'s\\nart.  contrari  to what everyon says, it is not trivial to\\nstrip them out in a global move; more important, softwar must\\nb made to do fanci trick not to take line end alon as\\nseparators; to make it ignor hyphen at line end is even\\nharder.  yes, i know it can be done, but whi must we bother?\\nremov hyphen from such text is the singl most difficult and\\ntime-consum job i have had, and the one with the highest risk\\nof introduc error into an alreadi proof-read text.\\n \\n3. the tlg preserv page layout inform in a fanat way:\\ne.g. it will tell you that a given line is to be indent by so many\\ntabs, but not that it is a vers quotation.  translat the\\ntab to space is easi enough, but whi not just have a tag to\\nmark vers and the particular metre?\\n \\n4. markup for standard refer style is there in the tlg, but\\ninconsist implement from author to author.  in the\\nplaton corpus, for example, stephanu page and column are\\ndeclar at the head of each dialogu and subsequently\\nincr by a flag; a special programm is need to convert\\nth 79th [x] after a declar [x21] actual mean stephanus\\npag 100.  line number are usual suppress (although they\\nar part of the standard refer format for plato), but\\noccasion line are indic explicitly.  no guidanc is\\ngiven as to whi thi is so, when the much more import page\\nand column refer are so badli handled.\\n \\n5. never let anyon tell you that a decent proofread job can\\nb done by someon who doe not know the languag well\\nor is not read with attent to the sense.  the tlg\\nwa keyboarded, not scanned, and yet broken charact in the\\nprint edit use have turn up as the wrong charact in\\nth final correct file (burnet\\' oxford text of plato is\\nstil run on the origin plate and there are a lot of\\nbroken charact which no liter reader could mistake; but no one caught\\nth rho with the miss tail: look just like an omicron and would\\neven have scan as one; the best visual confirm base on\\ncomparison with the print sourc would not reveal an error).\\ni fear that scholar are realli go to have to have one round\\nof proofread everything, so i am pleas that some humanists\\nfeel that keyboard milton can be fun.\\n \\n6. standard code delimit are need which can be regarded\\na non-separ by softwar (i guess that mean that the opening\\nand close delimit must be charact never use as delimiters,\\nparenthes or punctuat marks).  otherwis the code use to\\nmark a conjectur supplement will break the word when the text\\nstream is analyz by software.\\n \\n7. if you realli want the kind of inform which would make\\nan electron text use for seriou editori work (full\\napparatus, notat of font changes, chang of hands, etc.) then\\nit seem to me you need someth more than an electron text.\\nyou probabl need a hyper-text system of some sort or a\\nfantast complex data-base-cum-text.  with custom software.\\ni start from the assumpt that most user of electron texts\\nwant a clean accur electron copy, well-referenced, so that\\nthey can mark it up for their own analyt purpos or search\\nfor and analyz the word in it.  it is a job of an entirely\\ndiffer order to prepar a data base which can be use to help\\nedit a text.  the tlg\\' omiss of textual apparatu is much\\nlamented, and reason so; but in thi case i think they got\\nit right.  better to get the text out and make it usable.  if\\nthey had wait to settl on how to handl the apparatu in the\\nelectron text, (a) we would still be wait for the tlg, and\\n(b) they would have had, in effect, to re-edit all of ancient\\ngreek literature, not just enter and correct.  the editorial\\ntal for that job simpli doe not exist.  the media via of\\njust type the apparatu which happen to be in the text you\\nchoos to keyboard or scan is a perfect exampl of falling\\nbetween two stools: not enough to make electron analysis\\npossible, too much for absolut eas of use and speed of\\nproduction.\\n \\nthi is all pretti bitty, but that is how user\\' experience\\ntend to come out, i guess.  mayb the peon\\' perspect will\\nb of some use when the theoret issu threaten to get out\\nof hand -- or proportion.\\n \\nbrad inwood \\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: gaudeamu igitur in about 200 lines\\ndate: 14 decemb 1987, 23:49:56 est\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 558

the tags\\nar descript rather than procedural, you need not encod the\\nspecif of your word-processor, printer, current style sheet,\\ndisplay characteristics, etc. etc. a block quot is still a block\\nquot regardless of ani of these factors. also, becaus the tag are\\nmnemon and pure ascii, even with *no* word-processor a human can\\nread an sgml file.\\n\\nth object i hear to sgml are usually:\\n\\n1) \"it doesn\\'t have the tag i need.\" thi show a widespread\\nmisunderstand of sgml. sgml is not a tag-set at all, but a way of\\n*specifying* tag-sets, entity-names, and their syntax. a well-known\\ntag-set call \"aap\" (for it is from the american associ of\\npublishers) is *one* instanc of an sgml-conform tag-set; but\\nsay it \"is\" sgml is like say that a particular user program \"is\"\\npascal.\\n\\n2) \"it take up too much space.\" but just about ani mnemon for (say)\\nparagraph is sure to be shorter than 2 return and 5 spaces, or\\nprocedur command to skip line and chang the indent level,\\netc., etc. one can also defin abbrevi (say, for \"ℵ\"),\\ngain the breviti of transliter without lose the other\\nadvantages, all within the easi part of the sgml standard. so, for\\nexample, if one is do a lot of hebrew, one defin a \"\"\\ntag, within the scope of which a defin transliter scheme is\\nused.\\n\\n3) \"type pointi bracket and mnemon is a pain.\" sgml say nothing\\nwhatsoev about what you have to type. ani word-processor with \"style\\nsheets\" at least allow sgml-like mnemon descriptor -- and how you\\nspecifi them is as vari as the program themselves. also, it seems\\nobvi that even *typing* a mnemon is less pain than the usual task\\nof translat the mnemon into a long seri of format codes\\nwhich are specif to some particular word processor.\\n\\n4) \"slash (or whatever) are better than pointi brackets.\" thi is of\\ncours insignificant. one can chang the default, but in ani case the\\nchoic of tag punctuat is a trivial matter. global chang \"\"\\nto \":p.\" is a problem of a veri differ magnitud from locat all\\nparagraph given onli a file with miscellan carriag return and\\nspaces, some of which sometim happen to mark paragraphs. it\\' the\\ndiffer between artifici intellig and a text-editor \"change\"\\ncommand.\\n\\n5) \"sgml isn\\'t wysywyg\". thi is simpli false; just as with typing,\\nth display can be anything. ms word use style sheet (which is a\\nveri poor but real exampl of a descript tag system) is no less\\n\"wysiwyg\" than ms word use (shudder!) rote format all the time.\\nof course, the true, ultim \"wysiwyg\" word-processor is the pencil.\\n\\n6) \"sgml isn\\'t effici enough for purpos x.\" usually, x is some\\nspeci kind of inform retrieval. one must consid fisher\\'s\\nfundament theorom from genetics: \"the better adapt a system is to\\na particular environment, the less adapt it is to new\\nenvironments.\" to draw an analog from my own domain, one can always\\ndesign a special grammat theori for a singl language, which\\ni more effect for that languag than ani of the gener theories.\\nbut linguist are train to avoid this, becaus such analysi usually\\ncontribut noth to the work of student of other languages. it is\\ntru also in comput science: if one optim a program for one\\nmachine/language/ task, it will be vastli more difficult to adapt it\\nfor a new of extend one. an sgml file can be trivial convert to\\noth form for special purposes.  consid that the sgml version of\\nth entir o can be search in a small number of seconds.\\n\\n\\non anoth topic, it\\' interest to watch the multi-task debate.\\nther is so much about os-2 and windows. discuss with microsoft\\nind it ha littl conscious of the problem of writing\\nsystems. even accent are not

without activ participating.  my offic is next to\\nwillard\\' so i figur he could respond for the cch as a whole.  willard\\nask about deskview and window etc.  i just acquir both packag along\\nwith a mous and 4 meg extend memori and 1 meg expand memory.  both these\\npackag make use pc almost bearabl (i am hope to get a 386 machine\\nveri soon).  though some of my comput need may differ from the average\\nhumanist i have some idea of what they probabl need and also what they think\\nthey need.\\nther seem to be a gener fear of new technolog and a desir to make do\\nwith what is present avail rather then ventur into the *new wave*.\\nthi is a wast of comput power that is there for you if you dare!  i came\\nfrom the comput scienc depart to thi posit but have a strong\\nbackground in philosophy.  i would argu that machin could never think but\\nthat they are tool for achiev that which wa previous imposs or\\nveri time consuming.  i don\\'t want to start a discuss on the first claim\\nbut the second point is important.  if humanist are afraid of avail tools\\nthey are lose their own veri  valuabl time.  whi do a concord that takes\\n5 hour when with a faster machin it may take 1 hour?  it seem a false\\neconomi inde if cost is the motiv factor.  analysi that would not be\\nundertaken with a slow machin could now be possible.  i\\'m not advocating\\nthat everyon rush out and buy the fastest machin on the market today but\\npeopl should tri to not be so aprehens of the chang technology.\\n\\nal thi said, what are the present altern to dos?  both deskview and\\nwindow are superior to do stand alone.  they are not replac to dos\\nbut rather enhancements.  they allow you to use a mouse, for thi reason alone\\ny should be convinced.  the use of a mous is a great time saver.  but this\\ni just a bonus, the true joy of these system is their multitask ability.\\nanyon who ha use tex will will be happi that they can have their favorite\\nword processor, preview and tex all run at the same time.  you can use\\nth spooler and work on someth els too.  you could be even download a\\nhug document with your modem at the same time.  it is like have a room full\\nof comput all access the same files, but capabl of do completely\\ndiffer task at the same time.  you could even view multipl task on the\\nsam screen.  os/2 will not be abl to do thi with do task so there is no\\npoint in use it.  you are not forc to buy (expensive) expand memori to\\nus deskview.  it can swap program on and off your hard disk as they become\\nactivated.  it is like a larg ramdisk (though it is a bit slower).\\ni realiz that i have rambl on a bit too much.  the point is that it is\\nfrustr to see peopl afraid of new technolog which could save them a lot\\nof time and work in the long run. i guess the question is whether it is worth\\nth effort to keep up. if the answer is \"no\" there will be mani important\\nansw that humanist are search for that will never

hockey\\' recent contribution, to help\\navoid possibl misunderstand on a coupl of details:\\n\\n(1) current three differ tlg cd-rom have been\\nproduced, dub \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". the tlg \"a\" disk\\nwa issu in the summer/fal of 1985 in a provisional,\\npion (pre high sierra) format that simultaneously\\nwa made avail on the new ibycu scholarli computer.\\nsubsequently, ccat (with packard foundat funding)\\ndevelop experiment prototyp program to access the\\n\"a\" disk from ibm type machines.\\n\\nth tlg \"b\" disk appear soon after, prepar as a\\nvers of the \"a\" materi (or at least of the greek texts\\non the \"a\" disk, which also had some latin and other texts)\\nwith lexic indic by brown univers (paul kahn) in\\ncooper with harvard (gregori crane). thi disk doe not\\nrun on ibycus, and ran veri fast on the machin for which\\nit wa intend (initi an ibm rt, i think). the softwar was\\nadapt for an ibm pc environ by randal smith, and,\\ni think, for an appl macintosh environ as well, although\\ni am sketchi on the exact details. gregori crane now use it\\non a mac, if i am not mistaken. the tlg cd-rom \"b\" use a\\nformat develop at mit, also pre-high sierra.\\n\\ntlg cd-rom \"c\" ha been master and is about to be released.\\nit use the (provisional) high sierra format and can, at a very\\nrudimentari level, be access by ani machin equip to read\\nthat format; ccat is develop softwar to use the \"c\" disk from\\nibm type machin (employ the recent releas do extension),\\nand ibycu ha redesign it access program to read the \"c\" disk.\\ncompl are caus by the intern id-loc formatting\\nof the materi on the disk, which must be decod for eas and\\neffici of access, but there is noth peculiarli \"ibycus\\noriented\" about thi disk. the tlg \"c\" disk also includes\\nindex at some level, although the ibycu access program does\\nnot make use of thi feature.\\n\\n(2) a \"sister cd-rom\" to the tlg \"c\" disk ha been prepar by\\nth packard human institut (phi) in cooper with ccat.\\nfor detail see offlin 17. thi disk is intend to be in the\\nsam \"high sierra\" format as the tlg \"c\" disk, and to employ the\\ntlg \"beta coding\" for id-locators. the ibycu softwar can read\\nth phi/ccat cd-rom, which ha been master and is about to be released\\nfor distribution. ccat also ha \"experimental\" softwar for reading\\nthi disk from ibm type machines. thi disk doe not contain indices.\\n\\n(3) it is not difficult to treat the cd-rom as a sourc from\\nwhich to offload particular text or portion of texts, so that\\na user\\' favorit softwar can then be appli to the offloaded\\nmaterial. thi is true on ibycu or on ibm, and is perhap the\\nmost obviou use of a cd-rom for the \"average\" user who is not\\nyet in a posit to make more sophist direct use of the\\nmaterials. for peopl who want to have access to larg bodies\\nof texts, even if onli for offloading, the econom and storage\\nadvantag are tremendous. i can give concret figures, as\\nexamples, if anyon cares.\\n\\nfinally, to susan\\' question -- what research benefit doe my\\naccess to cd-rom (via ibycus, i confess) offer? apart from the\\nobvi search and selecting, which can includ search the\\nentir corpu of avail greek (or latin, etc.) materi for\\na given word, phrase, combin of words, etc., i use the cd-roms\\na a refer point for qualiti control (correct of errors;\\nno small matter, at thi point!), as a conveni sourc for\\noffload (no need to hunt for the tape, mount it, etc.), and\\na a gigant pool in which to hunt for identifi papyri scraps,\\nunknown quotations/allusions, etc. (a special kind of searching).\\nbasically, they are at present for me repositori and base for\\nexcerpt and sophist index-typ searches. i have not yet\\ntri to do anyth imagin with the varieti of non-linear\\nor extended-linear file on the phi/ccat disk -- e.g. morphological\\nanalysis, parallel texts, text with variants, word lists.

think there is a common misconcept about the safeti of digitally\\nstor data that need to be addressed.\\n\\n   grant that the longev of most digit media current in existence\\nprob cannot be guarante to be greater than 30 years, there is a\\nsignific differ between digit and analog media. the crucial difference\\ni that digit media do not degrad gradual as they are stored, and they\\ncan be speedili duplic without loss of content in a way that other\\nmedia cannot. in addition, given the speed of technolog change, each\\ncopi oper is like to pack more and more inform into one\\nstorag unit. thi mean that over time, the copi process becomes\\neasi and easier. compar the oper of copi the tlg on magnet tape\\nto the oper of print a new copi of the cd-rom from the master\\nstamp

fact remain that a comput file is both more\\neasili duplic without error, and is more use for research than an\\nimage-bas represent of the same texts. perhap charact recognition\\nwil eventu solv

with allen renear of brown.\\n\\na point of terminology: the word `tagset\\' refer to the set of content\\nent indic in a comput store document. the issu of what tagset\\nto use is independ of the decis to use sgml or not.\\nth point that must be kept in mind about sgml that must be kept in mind\\ni that sgml is *not* a tag set -- it is a languag for rigor declaring\\na tagset and it associ grammar.  an sgml compli file consist of\\n2 components: (1) the prologue, a header which declar the tag and\\ndescrib their grammar, and (2) the tag text itself. the aap standard\\ndescrib a tagset -- and give the associ sgml declarations. that is,\\nit is a tagset that conform to the sgml standard in having,\\namong other things, an sgml declaration.\\n\\nmani of us believ that the import thing is that sgml provid a\\nstandard for declar and then use tagsets. but attempt to\\nstandard tagset themselv are much riskier projects.\\nfor one thing a great deal of ingenu and innov goe into\\na tagset. for another, a tagset may correspond to a work of scholarship\\nin itself, if the tag inform involv a new interpret of the\\nth text. consider, for example, the introduct of paragraph into a\\nmanuscript text, or the scansion of a work previous regard as ametrical.\\n\\ntagset often repres an improv understand of a text\\' structure\\nor of the rel import of differ aspect of that structure.\\nth may be innovative, they may be controversial. not the sort of thing\\nwhich is ripe for standardization.\\n\\ni understand that univers microfilm is accepting, as an experiment,\\nsom dissert in electron form -- provid they are mark up\\nin the aap tagset. well my dissert is rigor mark up -- but\\nther are no aap tag correspond to my *primitive_term_introduction*\\ntag, or my *counterexample* tag. in some case i add detail to what\\nseem to be an aap analogue: my definit is compos of a *definiendum*\\nand a *definiens* -- so far so good. but my definien contain *clauses*\\nand my definiendum a *predicate* tag. in more awkward case there may be\\nsemant incongru in tagset that no amount of granular adjustments\\nwil resolve. such tagset will be fundament incommensurable.\\n\\nstandard tagset support compar work, so we should explor them\\nand creat them. but we should not hold out too much hope for them if we\\nexpect them to be adequ for all applications. extens within\\na uniform structur is an essential.\\n\\nth import thing is that 1) the manuscript be tag and\\n2) the tag and their grammar be declar in a prologu and\\nth 3) the tag be gloss as to their meaning.\\n\\nsgml provid a way of do 1) and 2) -- without restrict anyone\\nto ani particular tagset. the problem of 3) -- standard a semantic\\ngloss -- is still up for grab -- but i doubt if much more can\\nb done than to describ their mean as clearli as possibl in english.\\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: cd-rom bibliography\\ndate: 11 februari 1988, 16:12:15

(3) after memori ha been infect on a friday the 13th (the next\\nsuch date be may 13, 1988), ani com or exe file which is execut on\\nthat date get deleted.  moreover, it may be that other file are also af-\\nfect on that date; i\\'m still check thi out.\\n \\n(if thi is correct, then use of norton\\' uneras or some similar utility\\nto restor file which are eras on that date will not be sufficient.)\\n \\n   note that thi viru infect even read-onli files, that it doe not\\nchang the date and time of the file which it infects, and that while the\\nviru cannot infect a write-protect diskette, you get no clue that an at-\\ntempt ha been made by a \"write protect error\" messag sinc the pos-\\nsibl of write is check befor an actual attempt to write is made.\\n \\n   it is possibl that the whole thing might not have been discov in\\ntim were it not for the fact that when the viru code is present, an exe\\nfil is increas in size *every* time it is executed.  thi enlarg of\\nex file on each execut is appar a bug; probabl the intent was\\nthat it should grow onli once, as with com files, and it is fortun that\\nth continu growth of the exe file enabl us to discov the viru much\\nsoon than otherwise.\\n \\n   from the abov it follow that you can fairli easili detect whether your\\nfil have becom infected.  simpli choos one of your exe files\\n(prefer your most frequent execut one), note it length, and ex-\\necut it twice.  if it doe not grow, it is not infect by thi virus.\\nif it does, the present file is infected, and so, probably, are some of\\nyour other files.  (anoth way of detect thi viru is to look for the\\nstr \"sumsdos\" in byte 4-10 of com file or about 1800 byte befor the\\nend of exe files; however, thi method is less reliabl sinc the string\\ncan be alter without attenu the virus.)\\n \\n   if ani of you have heard of thi viru in your area, pleas let me know;\\nperhap it is an import after all.  (pleas specifi dates; our wa noticed\\non dec. 24 but presum first infect our disk much earlier.)\\n \\n   fortunately, both an \"antidote\" and a \"vaccine\" have been develop for\\nthi virus.  the first program cure alreadi infect file by remov the\\nviru code, while the second (a ram-resid program) prevent futur in-\\nfect of memori and display a messag when there is ani attempt to in-\\nfect it.  one such pair of program wa written primarili by yuval rakavy,\\na student in our comput scienc dept.\\n \\n   in their present form these two program are specif to thi particular\\nvirus; they will not help with ani other, and of course, the author of the\\npres viru may develop a mutant against which these two program will be\\nineffective.  on the other hand, it is to the credit of our peopl that\\nthey were abl to come up with the abov two program within a relatively\\nshort time.\\n \\n   my origin intent wa to put thi softwar on some server so that it\\ncould be avail to all free of charge.  however, the power that be have\\ndecre that it may not be distribut outsid our univers except under\\nspeci circumstances, for exampl that an epidem of thi viru actually\\nexist at the request site and that a formal request is sent to our head\\nof comput secur by the manag of the institution.\\n \\n   incidentally, long befor the appear of thi virus, i had been using\\na softwar equival of a write-protect tab, i.e. a program to prevent\\nwrit onto a hard disk, especi when test new software.  it is\\ncal protect, wa written by tom kihlken, and appear in the jan. 13,\\n1987 issu of pc magazine; a slightli amend version wa submit to the\\ninfo-ibmpc library.  though i origin had my doubts, it turn out that\\nit is effect against thi virus, although it wouldn\\'t be too hard to\\ndevelop a viru or trojan hors for which thi would not be true.  (bi the\\nway, i notic in issu 3 of the digest, which i receiv onli thi morning,\\nthat the version of protect.asm in the info-ibmpc librari ha been replaced\\nbi anoth version submit by r. kleinrensing.  however, in one respect\\nth new version seem to be inferior: one should *not* write-protect all\\ndriv abov c: becaus that might prevent you from write to a ramdisk or\\nan auxiliari diskett drive.)\\n \\n   of course, thi is onli the beginning.  we can expect to see mani new\\nvirus both here and abroad.  in fact, two other have alreadi been dis-\\ncov here.  in both case the target date is april 1.  one affect only\\ncom files, while the other affect onli exe files.  what they do on that\\ndat is to display a \"ha ha\" messag and lock up, forc you to cold boot.\\nmoreov (at least in the exe version), there is also a lockup one hour\\naft infect of memori on ani day on which you use the default date of\\n1-1-80.  (these virus may actual be older than the above-described\\nvirus, but simpli weren\\'t notic earlier sinc they extend file only\\nonce.)\\n \\n   the author of the above-ment anti-vir softwar ha now

message.\\nmoreover, the medium itself is still somewhat unreliable.\\nintern evid show that not all messag alway get through\\nto all recipients, nor do they alway arriv in the order in\\nwhich they were despatch or (presumably) composed. thi report\\ni base onli on the messag which actual reach me here in\\noxford; concern the rest i remain (on sound wittgensteinian\\nprinciples) silent. i am equal silent on messag in categories\\na and c above, which are of pure transient interest.\\n \\nspace preclud anyth more than a simpl indic of the\\nrang of topic on which humanist have sought (and often\\nobtained) guidance. in categori q over the last six month i\\nfound messag ask for inform on typesett with a\\npostscript interface, on scanner capabl of deal with\\nmicroform, about all sort of differ machin readabl texts\\nand about softwar for esl teaching, for librari cataloguing, for\\ncheck spelling, for brows foreign languag texts, and for\\nword process in sanskrit. humanist ask for electron mail\\naddress in greec and in australia, for concord packages\\nfor the macintosh and the amiga st, for address list and\\nbibliographies; they wonder who had use the programming\\nlanguag icon and whether imag process could be use to\\nanalys corrupt manuscripts; they ask for detail of the\\norganis structur of human comput centr and of\\nth standard for catalogu of comput media.\\n \\nabov all however, humanist argue. back in august 1987 humanist\\nwa onli a few month old, yet mani issu which have since\\nbecom familiar to it readership were alreadi on the agenda.\\nwher exactli are the human as a discipline? what is their\\nrel to scienc and technology? correspond refer to\\nth infam \"two cultures\" debat of the late fifties, somehow\\nnow more relev to the kind of \"cross-disciplinari soup we are\\ncooking\", but rather than re-flay that particular dead horse,\\nth discuss move rapidli to anoth recurr worry: did the\\nintroduct of comput chang humanist scholarship\\nquantit or qualitatively? doe electron mail differ only\\nin scale and effect from the runner with the cleft stick?\\ndo comput mere provid better tool to do task we have\\nalway want to do? the opinion of one correspond (\"if\\ncomput weren\\'t around, i doubt veri much if mani of the ways\\nw think about text would have come to be\") provok another\\ninto demand (reason enough) evidence. such evid as was\\nforthcoming, however, did conced the point that \"it could all be\\ndon without comput in some theoret sense, but certainly\\nnot as quickly\". refer wa made to a forthcom collection\\nof essay which might settl whether or not it wa chimer to\\nhop that comput will somehow assist not just in marshaling\\nth evid but in provid interpret of it.\\n \\na second leitmotiv of humanist discuss wa first heard\\ntoward the end of august, when an enquiri about the availability\\nof some text in machin readabl form provok an assert of\\nth moral respons the prepar of such text should\\naccept for make their exist well known and prefer for\\ndeposit them in a text archiv for the benefit of all. a note\\nof caution concern copyright wa also first sound here, and\\nit wa suggest that those respons for new edit should\\nalway attempt to retain control over the right to electronic\\ndistribut of their material.\\n \\nwith the start of the new academ year, humanist becam more\\ndomin by specif enquiries, and a compar low key\\nwrangl about whether or not product announcements, software\\nreview and the like should be allow to sulli it airspace.\\ncharacteristically, thi also provid the occas for some\\nhumanist to engag in an amus socio-linguist discuss of\\nth phenomenon known as \"flaming\", while other plaintiv asked\\nfor \"less chatter about the comput which is onli a tool and\\nmor about what we are use it for\". it appear that some far\\nflung humanist actual have to pay money proportion to the\\nsiz of the mail they accept, recal an earlier remark\\nabout the uniqu privileg natur of the bulk of those\\nenjoy the delight of thi new time-waster, which wa (a one\\neuropean put it) \"sure *founded* for chatter\".\\n \\nin mid october, a fairli pedestrian discuss about the general\\nlack of recognit for comput activ and publications\\nsuddenli took off with the re-emerg of the copyright problems\\nref to above. if electron public wa on a par with\\npap publication, sure the same principl of ownership and\\ndu regard for scholarli labour appli to it? but did thi not\\nmitig against the current easi camaraderi with which\\narticles, gossip and note are transfer from one medium to\\nanother? as inde are those more substanti fruit of\\nelectron labours, such as machin readabl texts? for one\\ncorrespond such activities, without explicit permission, were\\n\"a measur of the anesthet effect of the xerox machin on\\nour moral sense\". for another, howev \"ask conced the other\\nparty\\' right to refuse\".\\n \\nin mid-november, after a particularli rebarb electron foul\\nup, minim editori supervis of all humanist submiss was\\ninitiated. other than some discuss of the \"conversational\\nstyle\" appropri to the network, thi appear to have had\\nlittl or no inhibitori effect on either the scale or the manner\\nof subsequ contributions.\\n \\nan enquiri about the avail of some akkadian text led to a\\nrep assert of the import to scholarship of reliable\\nmachin readabl texts. convent publish were widely\\ncastig for their short-sight unwilling to make such\\nmateri avail (be compar on one occas to mediaeval\\nmonk use manuscript for candles, and on anoth to\\nrenaiss printer throw away carolingian manuscript once\\nthey had been set in type). humanist were exhort to exert peer\\npressur on publishers, to pool their expertis in the definition\\nof standards, to work togeth for the establish of a\\nconsortium of centr which could offer archiv facil and\\ndefin standards. more realist perhaps, some humanists\\nremark that publish were unlik to respond to idealistic\\npressur and that a network of librari and data archives\\nalreadi exist which could do all of the requir task and more\\nwer it suffici motiv and directed. at present, said\\none, all we have is \"a poor man\\' archive\" depend on voluntary\\nsupport. other were more optimist about the possibl of\\nfound a \"north american text archiv and servic center\" and\\nless optimist about the wisdom of leav such affair to the\\nlaw of the marketplace. one intrigu propos wa that a\\nnat or intern archiv might be manag as a giant\\ndistribut database.\\n \\nfollow the highli success vassar confer on text\\nencod standard in mid november, a long seri of\\ncontribut address the issu of how text should be encoded\\nfor deposit in (or issu from) such an archive. no one seem to\\nhav serious dissent from the view that descript rather\\nthan procedur markup wa desirable, nor to have propos any\\nmethod to describ such markup other than sgml, so that it is a\\nlittl hard to see quit what all the fuss wa about - unless it\\nwa necessari to combat the apathi of long establish practise.\\n \\none controversi which did emerg concern the desir (or\\nfeasibility) of enforc a minim encod system, and the\\next to which thi wa a fit role for an archiv to take on.\\n\"tri to save the past is just go to retard development\"\\nargu one, while anoth lone voic assert a \"rage for chaos\"\\nand prais \"polymorph encoding\" on the ground that all\\nencod system were inher subject (\"everi decod is\\nanoth encoding\" to quot morri zapp). anxieti wa expressed\\nabout the danger of bureaucracy. both view were, to the middle\\nground at least, equal misconceived. in the first case, no-one\\nwa propos that past error should dictat futur standards,\\nbut onli that safeguard what had been achiev wa a different\\nact from propos what should be done in the future. in the\\nsecond case, no-on wish to fetter (or to \"prussianize\")\\nscholarli ingenuity, onli to defin a common languag for its\\nexpression.\\n \\nthere wa also much support for the commonsens view that\\nconvers of an exist text to an adequ level of markup up\\nwa gener much less work than start from scratch. clearly,\\nhowever, a lot depend on what is meant by \"generally\" and by\\n\"adequate\": for one humanist an adequ markup wa one from\\nwhich the \"origin form of a document\" could be re-created, thus\\nrath beg the question of how that \"origin form\" wa to be\\ndefined. to insist on such a distinct between \"object text\"\\nand \"subject commentary\" is \"to miss the point of literary\\ncritic altogether\" as anoth put it.\\n \\none technic problem with sgml which wa identified, though not\\nmuch discussed, wa it awkward at handl multiply\\nhierarch structur within a singl document; one straw man\\nwhich wa repeatedli shot down wa the appar verbos of most\\ncurr implement use it. however, as one correspondent\\npoint out, the sgml standard exist and wa not go to\\ndisappear. it wa up to humanist to make the best use of it by\\npropos tag set appropri to their needs, perhap use some\\nsort of data dictionari to help in thi task.\\n \\nat the end of 1987 it seem that \"text markup and encod have\\nturn out to be the issu for humanist to get productively\\nexcit about\". yet the new year saw an entir new topic sweep\\nal other aside. a discuss on the style of softwar most\\nappropri for humanist research soon focus on an energetic\\ndeb about the potenti of hypertext systems. it wa clear to\\nsom that the text-analysi featur of exist softwar systems\\nwer primit and the task they facilit \"critic naive\".\\nwould hypertext systems, in which discret unit of text,\\ngraph etc. are tightli coupl to form an arbitrarili complex\\nnetwork, offer ani improv on sequenti searching, database\\nconstruction, concordanc visibl token and so forth?\\nparticip in thi discuss rang more wide than usual\\nbetween the evangel and the ill-informed, so that rather more\\nheat than light wa gener on the topic of what was\\ndistinct new about hypertext, but sever use point and\\nan excel bibliographi did emerge.\\n \\na hypertext system, it wa agreed, did extend the rang of what\\nwa possibl with a comput (provid you could find one\\npow enough to run it), though whether or not it facilities\\nwer fundament new remain a moot (and familiar) point. it\\nalso seem (to thi reader at least) that the fundament notion\\nof hypertext deriv from somewhat primit view of the way\\nhuman reason proceeds. the hypertext paradigm doe not regard\\na primit such mental activ as aggreg or\\ncategoris (thi x is a sort of y) or semant relationships\\n(al xs are potenti yd to that z), which lie at the root of\\nth way most current databas system are designed. nevertheless\\nit clearli offer excit possibl - certainli more\\nexcit (in one humanist\\' memor phrase) than \"the discovery\\nof the dung beetl enter my apartment\".\\n \\nconsider about the absenc of softwar for analys the\\nplac of individu text within a larger cultur context lead\\nsom humanist to ponder the rule determin the exist of\\nsoftwar of ani particular type. wa there perhap some necessary\\nconnexion between the facil offer by current software\\nsystem and current critic dogma? one respond favour a\\nsimpl explanation: \"straightforward concord program are\\ntrivi in comparison to dbm and i think that explain the\\nsitu much better than doe the theori of predominant\\nliterari schools\". it seem as if humanist get not just \"the\\narch they deserve\" but the softwar that\\' easiest to write.\\n \\n \\n   -----------tabl for the humanist

unlik basic, fortran, snobol, etc., it *forces*\\nth programm into a more structured, procedurally-ori approach.\\n \\nfor me icon serv as an excel start point.  befor this, i had\\nlearn a littl

programs,\\non begin write use and even veri power programs.\\n \\nafter learn icon, one can then move into lower-level languages.  it\\'s\\na littl hard to get use to have to tell the compil how much storage\\nto allot everi variabl (i.e. to oper without \"garbag collection\")\\nbut overall, it seem much easier to begin program in c after icon\\nthan before.  i know becaus i tried.  c seem incred

bible\\nexist in variou stage of verif and availability. two\\nthat we at ccat were unabl to obtain for use in the septuagint\\nproject (catss) are by the late gerard weil and hi french\\nteam, and by franci andersen and dean forb in australia.\\nearli in the game, the result from the mareds (belgium)\\nproject were also unavailable, so we commiss richard\\nwhitak to creat program for automat analysi on the\\nold ibycu system in the ibyx languag (similar to c).\\na we made progress on thi project, negoti with the\\nmareds project becam more favorable, so now the results\\nfrom the whitak program and from mareds are be collated\\nand corrected/verifi as necessari by the westminst seminary\\nteam under alan groves. our desir is to make thi material\\navaialbl for scholarli research, and if there is some way that\\nwhitaker\\' code could be of help, i am will to investigate\\nth question further along those lines. i know noth beyond\\nwhat robin commun about the other player in thi game,\\nexcept that dean forb did the program for the andersen\\nanalysi and could be approach about hi code as well.\\n \\n(2) the discuss of greek analysi program should make note of\\nth pioneer effort of david packard, whose morpholog analysis\\nprogram written for ibm manifram ha been around for a veri long\\ntim and is describ in an articl from one of the linguistic\\ncomput confer at pisa. thi program is mount in various\\ncenters, the most recent of which is manchest (robin refer to\\ntoni smith there), which ha permiss to serv as a center for\\noth to access the program electronically.\\n \\n(3) analysi program for other languag also exist, and are sometimes\\navail in one way or another. we were abl to obtain delatte\\'s\\nlatin program (liege) for use on project

no, say i).  are infinit absol-\\nut to be classifi as adverbs, nouns, verbs, or what (sometim one or ano-\\nth of these class will be better)?   the problem we are get into here\\ni that in hebrew, a word\\' class will depend partli on morphology, and partly\\non it extern syntax.  it\\' not like latin, where the morpholog will pretty\\nmuch tell us a word\\' class.  nor is it like english, where extern syntax or\\nth lexicon will usual tell us thi information.  whether we adopt a tradit-\\nional, morpholog approach to classif (the \"classical\" tradit -\\nwhich like to impos greek or latin categori on languag where it is com-\\nplet inappropriate), or a more broad one, will be terribl subjective.\\n \\nmi feeling, therefore, is that if i can, i\\'d like to find out if a true parser\\ni possibl for biblic hebrew.  sure, i\\'ll use analyz text if i need to.\\ni want to know, however, if the other altern is - even dimli - feasible.\\n \\nnow, about the dictionary:  i have no object to one.  certainli native\\nspeak of ani languag will memor a great deal.  so whi shouldn\\'t our\\npars programs?  if i have to lexic tens distinct like \"go\" and\\n\"went,\" whi not let my parser lexic them, too?\\n \\ni also have no object to front end to parsers, which have list of the\\nmost frequent word handili pre-analyzed.  use such a modul cut down\\nth amount of work a parser ha to do, while not crippl it in ani way.\\n \\nin sum, then, i don\\'t at all object to tables, dictionaries, etc.  nor do i\\nobject to analyz text.  it\\' just that in the latter case, i\\'d like to try\\nto see whether i can get along without it.  again, if anyon know of any\\nrelev articl on semit languag (like, say the recent one on arabic\\nin comput in translation), pleas drop me a line!\\n \\nmani thank again.\\n \\n                                                  -richard l. goerwitz\\n                                                  goer@sophist.uchicago.edu\\n                                                  !ihnp4!gargoyle!sophist!goer\\n\\nfrom: mccarty@utorepas\\nsubject: hypertext, on-lin dictionari (80 lines)\\ndate: 23 februari 1988, 00:35:00 est\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 785 (785)\\n\\n----------------------------\\nfrom elli@husc6.bitnet (elli mylonas)\\n \\n \\n        >thi is partli in respons to joe giampapa\\' question about on-\\n        >line dictionari for natur languag process and partli a\\n        >descript of a hypertext system which humanist may be\\n        >interest in know about.\\n \\nsinc the perseu project wa mention by randal smith in a recent\\nposting, i would like to clarifi and add to hi descript of the\\nproject.\\n \\n        >greg crane at the harvard univers classic depart is\\n        >work on a model greek hypertext system call \"perseus.\"  this\\n        >model, when complete, will have a greek text link to an\\n        >_apparatu criticus_, dictionary, grammar, metric scansion, and\\n        >commentari for teach purposes.\\n \\nthe perseu project is collect visual and textual data on classical\\ngreec and put it togeth in such a way that it may be use for teaching\\nand research.  the project is take place both at harvard and at boston\\nuniversity.  the textual data will consist of greek texts, translations,\\nmeter, app. crit. and notes. the latter two item may not be provid for every\\ntext, but will certainli be avail for a basic canon.

  in a\\nperson    computer.      an inform  retriev system makes\\ndiscoveri   of histor  kind and     cross    data  analysis\\npossible.    the data of  about  4000 libretti have been actually\\nencoded.\\n \\n  the   other  project  is carri  out   by  the   collaboration\\namong   sever  institut   as  the  univers  of   ferrara,\\nrome,   pisa   and the  univers   of california  at  berkeley.\\nit deal with the  italian lyric  poetri of the   renaiss  in\\nmus   and   literari prints.    the  aim  is to   realiz   a\\n100.000 poetic text data  base,  for public inform and\\nretriev of  \"lost\" poetri  from music  part-books. the  italian\\npart of the project is more relat to the literatur aspects.\\n \\n  furthermore,  we   have  to mention  the librari   of  encoding\\nmus piec of the musicolog divis of cnuce, about 1000\\npiec of differ authors. the librari is  also access from\\nremot user  belong to  the earn-bitnet  network and  is made\\neasi by a

deals\\nwith   sever field  as catalogu print music, textbook on\\nsing education,  and a  music themat  catalogu of  venetian\\nmusic.\\n \\n   other two  project are  the multipl  index of performance\\ndetail and text incipit of all comic  opera produc in naples\\nform 1700 to 1750  carri out at  the univers  of milan under\\nth direct  of  professor  degrada,  and  the  encod    and\\ncatalogu  of a music fund use technic devic as ocr or\\ncd-rom,  in   which  collabor  sever  institut  and  the\\nlaboratorio di informatica musical in milano.\\n \\n \\nconclusion\\n \\n  the   situat  of   comput applic  to  musicolog   in\\nitali  is   in evolution.    as i  mention abov  the  use   of\\ncomput  at   the univers depart  of music  and   in  the\\nconservatori  is  still   not well establish even   though  the\\npeopl    (scholars,     student    and researcher)  who   start\\nto interest in thi field is increasing.\\n \\n  one  may   also hope  that the  realiz  of   softwar  for\\nmusicolog  purpos will be more  and more concern with the\\ndesign    of   packag   which   can   be   use   by    several\\nresearchers.     the softwar  design  should  be  orient  to\\ncreat not onli experiment software,  that is use onli by the\\nresearch group who realiz it.\\n \\n   an interest  issu relat  to the problem of spread and\\npromot  the   use  of  comput  in  music  studi  is  its\\neduc implications.  mainly, the  use of  comput in music\\neduc is  onli concern with the studi of the comput music\\nitself or  the studi  of sound  processing. the music educational\\nact establish  which use  the comput  are the computer\\nmus cours  at  the  conservatori  of  music  l.  cherubini  in\\nflorence, the  onli one  in an italian conservatory, the computer\\nmus  summer   cours  held   at  the   centro   di   sonologia\\ncomputazional in  padova, and  other few  which also  deal  with\\nelectron music.  a three  day seminar  on  comput  and  music\\neduc ha  been held by myself last octob  at the centro di\\nricerca  e sperimentazion  per la  didattica, and  i will hold a\\nsumm cours  on  comput  and  musicolog  next  septemb  in\\nflorence.\\n \\n in  my opinion,  a veri import question is: how could be used\\nth methodolog approach of, say, music grammar to teach the\\ntheori of  melodi by  comput to   student  ? is it possibl to\\nintegr  the  methodolog and the realiz tool with, say, the\\ncurriculum of music histori and music analysi cours ?\\n \\n   my answer  is yes,  and i  think thi  is a  promis path to\\nfollow for the near future.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nreferences\\n \\n \\nselfridge-field, e.,  forthcoming. \"computer-bas  approach to\\nmus data  and  music  analysis:  a  technic  exchange\",

pascal sourc so that it would compil and run effici on a\\npc or at.  and carn ha done an excel job.   pctex run as fast on a\\ngood at as on a medium load vax.  plu you get the texbook, latex

your mainfram somewhere, if you have not alreadi discovered\\nit.\\n \\nin a purer sens of pd, there is monardo\\' common tex.  thi is the\\ntransl of tex into c.  thi is your for the download from

compil it yourself, though.\\nboth these version are also excellent, but you have no document or\\nhelp in get them up and going.  really, you have to have use tex before\\non some other system, so that you know where everyth should go, and how\\nto use tex.  you also have to get your own font and driver (also\\navail in pd from nelson beebe@science.utah.edu).  the point is, someone\\nwith the

(robert amsler)\\n \\ncurious. i wa deliber strive to say that comput scientists\\ndon\\'t know all that much about eas of use--or rather that concerns\\nabout formal syntax, theoret power and such might get in the way\\nof concern about simplic of learning, etc. anoth good example\\nof thi is basic. basic is a fine languag for simplic of\\nunderstanding--which wa it intend goal; however, i cring at the\\nthought of someon write complex system in basic.\\n \\ni am a comput linguist. it is quit reason for some massive\\nproject to be carri out in academia. they could even be done by\\na lone individual. i do feel that today someon should not undertake\\nsuch a project in snobol. when one get to do thing like writing\\nmechan translat system or creat symbol algebra\\ninterpret or develop text understand systems--th need is\\nfor a suitabl contemporari language. these project also should not\\nb done in fortran or c or pascal. they probabl should be done in\\nlisp or prolog. they may be done in fortran or c or pascal at\\ncommerci shop becaus they expect to sell the result software\\nto peopl who can onli run in those environments--but in research labs\\nor academ institut thi isn\\'t even typic the case.\\n \\nfinally, i didn\\'t intend the somewhat stronger statement that snobol\\ni onli good for rewrit or extractions. these happen to be the two\\nbroadest class of task i can think of for it use. pars is a\\nrewrit system, incidentally. so, pars isn\\'t someth i\\'d have\\nexclud in that even if i had meant it in the strongest sense. if i\\nwer to tri and imagin what task are not rewrit or extractions\\ni\\'d probabl have to say numer computations. a concord is a\\nrewrit task; automat index is an extract task. these seem\\nperfectli suit to snobol, be rather simpl procedures. ah,\\nther is one other class of programs--gener systems. snobol\\nwould also be excel there.\\n \\nthe main point of my messag wa that i wa tri to describ the\\njustif i could see for someon use snobol rather than any\\noth languag for some tasks. if one assum that someon didn\\'t\\nknow ani program languag and wa prepar to learn a language;\\nund what circumst should the languag they learn be snobol\\nrath than icon, c, fortran, basic, lisp, pascal, etc. i believe\\nther are reason thi is true. i also believ there are task in\\nwhich they should

note, \"comput scientists\\nand snobol\".\\n \\nhe made a coupl of point which i would not agre with.  part of giordano\\'s\\nargu wa as follows:\\n \\n    who among us write thousand of line of code anyway?  that sort\\n    of thing is develop by teams, team that are managed.  the\\n    select of a program languag in a team effort ha much\\n    more to do with manag decis and concern than it has\\n    to do with the intrins merit of thi or that particular language.\\n    thi explains, in part, whi there are so mani fortran and cobol\\n    shop around.  comput scientists, and their opinions, usual count\\n    for littl or noth in thi equation.\\n \\ni do not see the connect between the \"thousand of line of code\" and\\nth \"team that are managed\" statements.  thousand of line of code could be\\nwritten by one individual, or written by a team.  even if written by a team,\\nit doe not chang the problem of a larg program\\' readabl and\\nmanageability, as embodi by that language.\\n \\nthe criteria by which program languag are selected, i agree, are not\\nalway reduc to the concern of an optim language.  futur system support,\\nth avail of coder and implement of a languag on a system, and\\nth cost of maintain such a system are import manageri concerns.\\nhowever, it is ridicul to state that in a way which factor out the opinions\\nof comput scientist (or, pragmatically, the program coders).  there is no\\nway a manag can make effect project decis without comput know-how.\\nneith is it intellig to expect cost-effect work from programmers\\nwho have to work with a languag which wa chosen without their concern in\\nmind.  manag and programm have to work togeth in the best interests\\nof the project -- not in the mutual exclus interest of one side.  it\\ndisappoint me to feel i have to make such an obviou claim.\\n \\n \\n\"thi explains, in part, whi there are so mani fortran and cobol shop around.\"\\n \\ni do not know much about cobol, but i know that fortran is around becaus it\\nha had support of magnitud unriv by ani other language.  most user\\nlibrari for scientif comput were written and maintain in fortran,\\nand fortran is the unriv best optim compil language.  it make no\\nsens to rewrit everyth in c (which wa design for write programmer-\\noptim code).\\n \\nfinally, i would like to look at giordano\\' close paragraph:\\n \\n   i do have an object to amsler\\' implicit messag that computer\\n   scientist know best.  they don\\'t, but that\\' a differ story...\\n \\nit is good that humanist discuss express the author\\' emot involvement\\nin his/her side.  however, we should be a littl more consciou of when our\\nemot overtak our argument and have no bear on the matter.  whether\\nrich giordano thought that amsler had vest interest in make exaggerated\\nclaim about comput scientists, or not, or whether amsler did in fact make\\nthos claim (i do not know --- how wa the origin provoc letter\\nphrased?) are beyond the issu of giordano\\' prefer style of respond to\\nthem.  if rich giordano want to direct those comment to amsler, he should\\nhav done so directly.  not onli did giordano miss the target (amsler replies\\nthat he is a comput linguist), but he succeed in alien computer\\nscientist with hi irrelev comment.\\n \\na a comput scienc student and professional, i cannot allow such a\\nbaseless claim to go unheeded.  humanist is an open forum, with the message-\\npost assum full respons for her/hi statements.  it is also\\nacadem in nature, permit the unedit express of opinion and\\ninsights. it

and their opposites:\\n     rudeness, insult, abuse; joke relationships,\\n     avoid relationships; formality, informality, casual\\n     and non-casu interaction.  just as, at the level of\\n

a full-text retriev system\\nrun on an ibm mainfram at bar-ilan univers in israel. the\\nlargest part of thi databas (53 million words, 253 volumes,\\n53,000 documents) come from the \"responsa

more\\nthan 50 differ countries. it thu compris a veri rich\\nstorehous of inform on jewish law, history, philosophy,\\nethics, custom and folklore, and is of interest for both\\nreligi and secular

mediev biblic commentaries.\\n\\nbi arrang with the institut for inform retriev and\\ncomput linguist at bar-ilan, the databas is accessible\\nto anyon with a pc and a modem via a telecommun network\\nsuch as telenet or datapac. to date connect have been\\nestablish at the rabbin court of london, at the institute\\nfor comput in jewish life (chicago, illinois), and the centre\\nfor comput in the humanities, univ. of toronto, besid 25\\nconnect at variou research center in israel. the connection\\nin toronto is the onli one to a research institut outside\\nisrael; so far it ha been use both by member of the local\\njewish commun and by academics.\\n\\ncomput humanist without interest in the content of the\\ndatabas will, however, like be interest in it software.\\nalthough thi full-text retriev softwar wa develop at the\\ninstitut in bar-ilan especi for the hebrew database, it has\\nrec been adapt for use with english languag texts. it\\nallow search for word and phrase

a word\\nautomat by specifi mere it lemma.\\n\\nthrough the techniqu of \"short-context disambiguation\" the\\nsystem also permit most unwant occurr of a word to be\\nelimin befor full retrieval: occurr are group and\\nlist with their nearest verbal neighbours, either to the left\\nor right, and from thi list the user select which are to be\\nretrieved. sinc in gener the number of differ neighbors\\nthat are also rel frequent turn out to be quit small,\\nth user can disambigu a larg number of occurr quickly.\\nfor example, \"see\" caus \"see\", \"sees\", \"saw\", and \"seen\" to be\\nretrieved, while the differ between \"he saw\" and \"the saw\"\\nallow the homograph noun to be identifi and eliminated\\nimmediately.\\n\\nexperi have shown that nativ speaker have a high degre

few question relat to my post on prolog, yesterday.\\nher they are:\\n\\n1. \"ha prolog been standardized?\"\\n\\na far as i can tell, the most \"standard\" descript of the languag is that\\ngiven by clocksin and mellish, \"program in prolog\" (springer-verlag).\\nal implement must satisfi the minimum requir as state there.\\nsom implement may have more features, but that book is the bare-bones.\\ni think peopl at the univers of edinbergh would be better author on\\nwhat is the languag \"standard\".\\n\\n\\n2. \"can it \\'deal well\\' with non-western-european languages?\"\\n\\ni assum that thi make refer to the difficulti impos by string of\\ncharact in a non-roman charact set.  what one would have to do is\\ninclud in their prolog code routin which would map from an ascii character\\nset (or whatev your machin supports) to their own charact fonts.  the\\nprolog interpret doe not care what symbol it manipulates, so you could\\nconceiv run prolog in a special charact display package.  the degree\\nof \"well\" or effici depend on how well thi ha been implement at\\nyour site, and the sophist of your tools.  i do not know of any\\n\"altern charact set\" packag which will keep your system \"standard\"\\nin a portabl way, if you do need them.\\n\\n\\n3. \"will it realli be worth it to make the effort of learn prolog?\"\\n\\nsom task are easili suit for prolog, and the concis represent it\\ncan give you would be well worth while.  whether it is \"worth it\" depend on\\nth natur of your work.  it might well be worth some time and effort to\\nbecom more familiar with it for futur reference.\\n\\n\\n4. \"where is prolog\\' strong point?\"\\n\\nin a simplist way, the strength of a prolog system is in the way it\\nsearch for item in it database.  as long as it can find someth to\\nsatisfi it goals, it will proceed down to the next level, look there, and\\ncontinue.  if it cannot find someth to satisfi it goal, it will\\n\"backtrack\", which is a littl complic to explain.  in practice, if you\\nar pars a sentenc which can be pars in more than one way, prolog\\nwil automat return the altern pars trees.\\n\\n\\n5. \"could you offer a sampl of [...] someth that all of us might find\\nus - and explain what all the littl nick-nack mean?  then could you\\ndo the same for lisp in anoth posting?\"\\n\\nok.  what would be use to all?  a complet pars program with full\\ndocumentation?  someth else?  send me some suggest and i will pick\\nsometh from them.\\n\\n\\n\\nfinally, i would like to throw the door wide open for addit commentary.\\nsom

(an\\nappendix give prolog program that will do the transform for\\nyou, but it\\' worth do it manual on some sampl first.)\\n\\nthat is, the logic underpin of prolog as a system are almost\\na interest as what you can do with it as a language.  ***if you\\nthink symbol logic is or can be beautiful, i think you\\'ll like\\nprolog.***\\n\\nit should be noted, though, that it can be hard to switch from the\\nprocedural, step by step style of analysi one acquir from other\\nprogram languages, to the non-procedural, declar interpretation\\nof prolog programs.  there turn out to be lot of thing i know how to\\ndo step by step, that i cannot defin readili in predic calculus.\\nand sinc prolog program have both a declar and a procedural\\ninterpret (that is, they *are* program that are suppos to *do*\\nthings), work with prolog can induc some intellectu dizziness.\\n\\n2 prolog provid a conveni way to pars express using\\nchomsky-lik rewrit rules, and mani implement provid facilities\\nfor work with a special notat for such rewrit rules.  (this\\ni the \\'definite-claus grammar\\' notat mention by joe giampapa.)\\ni am less enthusiast about thi than most peopl seem to be, because\\nthes facil enforc a specif left-to-right pars strategy\\nthat seem on the whole better suit for thing like pascal programs\\nor sgml document compon hierarchi than for natur language\\ntexts.  (and even for such unnatur grammar i am have trouble\\nfind a definit claus notat that correctli pars an sgml\\ndocument -- mayb my fault and not that of the notation, but still\\nfrustrating.  ha anyon els done thi sort of thing with better\\nsuccess?  write me if you have.)\\n\\nbut even if one ignor the builtin \\'grammar\\' notat and write one\\'s\\nown parser, prolog handl a lot of the detail more conveniently\\n(*not* faster!) than other languages.  to pars a lot of text, i\\'d\\nalmost sure want to write a parser in some other language, for\\nspeed.  but onli after work out the pars strategi with prolog.\\n***for develop a parser, prolog ha a lot of advantages.***\\n\\nfinally, a note on products:  borland\\' turbo prolog is veri nice,\\nseem to run fast, and ha a conveni (though complicated)\\nmultiwindow interface.  but they achiev the speed by leav out\\nsom of the key featur of prolog, qua logic system.  you may\\nnot feel that you\\'v thrown your money away by buy turbo prolog,\\nbut if you are interest in logic, then you will eventu want a\\nful implementation.

so,\\nthen, in the real world, comput languag are not completely\\nintertranslatable.\\n     the upshot is that, depend on what one want to do with computers, one\\nwil have to use differ languages, and differ hardware/softwar systems.\\nth technolog of comput ha not done away with the tower of babel, or the\\nrequir for multilingualism.  though everi few years, new holi languages\\nfor our

(891)\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n     i\\'m look for a search engin which probabl doe not exist, but\\ni would like advic from those more knowledg about text retrieval\\nsystems.  it is a text retriev system optim for literary-critical\\nand linguist study.  the major requir for the search engin are\\na follows:\\n\\n(1)  literari text should be \"understood\" by the system in term of the\\nindividu document structure, as indic by markup elements. the user\\nshould be abl to specifi within a search argument that proximity\\nvalues, posit operators, compar oper and logical\\noper govern the search argument and the textual units\\nto-be-search in accord with the hierarch structur of the\\ndocument.  that is, if a document is compos of books, chapters,\\npericopes, vers and words, then express within the search argument\\nmust be abl to refer to these particular textual units.  if another\\ndocu (or the *same* document, view under a differ hierarchical\\nstructure) contain chapters, paragraphs, sub-paragraphs, (strophes),\\nsent and words, then express in the search argument should be\\nfram in term of these textual units.  to borrow a definit of\\n\"text\" from the brown-brandeis-harvard chug group: the text retrieval\\nsystem must be capabl of view each of it document or text as an\\n\"ord hierarchi of content object (ohco).\"\\n\\n(2)  the databas structur must be capabl of support annotations\\n(or assign attributes) at the word level, and ideally, at ani higher\\ntextu level appropri to the given document.  most record-based\\nretriev system cannot accommod the word-level annot that\\ntextu scholar or linguist would like to assign to \"words.\"  more\\ncommonly, if such databas can be modifi to accommod annotations\\nat the word level, the record-field structur is therebi contort in\\nway that introduc new constraint on search (inabl to span\\nrecord boundaries, for example).  preferably, even the definit of\\n\"word\" ought not to be hard-cod into the system.  hebrew, for\\ninstance, contain \"words\" (graphic unit bound by spaces) which\\ncontain three or four distinct lemmas.  minimally, the databas must\\nsupport annot at the word level (e.g., to account for the\\nassign of lemma, gloss, morpholog parse, syntact function,\\netc) and these annot must be access to the search\\nengine/argument.  though not absolut required, it is desir that\\nattribut could be assign to textual unit abov \"word,\" and such\\nattribut should be open to specif in the search argument.\\nlinguist studi discourse, for example, might wish to assign\\nattributes/annot at the sentenc or paragraph level.\\n\\n(3)  the search engin should support the full rang of logic operators\\n(boolean and, or, not, xor), user-defin proxim valu (within the\\nsame, or within \"n\" textual units), user-defin posit operators\\n(preced relat govern express or term within the search\\nargument) and compar oper (for numer values).  the search\\nargu should permit nest of express by parenthes within the\\nlarg boolean search argument.  full regular-express pattern\\nmatch (grep) should be supported, as well as macro\\n(library/thesaurus) facil for design textual corpora to be searched,\\ndiscontinu rang or text-span within documents, synonym groups,\\netc.  other standard featur of power text retriev system are\\nassum (set oper on indices; session histories; statistical\\npackages; etc).\\n\\n     most commerci search engin i have evalu support a subset of\\nth featur in (3), but do veri poorli in support of (1) and (2).  the\\ntext retriev system which claim to be \"full text\" system actually\\nhav fairli crude definit of \"text,\" and attempt to press textual\\ndata into rigid record-field format that do not recogn hierarchical\\ndocu structures, or are not suffici flexibl to account for a\\nwid rang of document types.  three commerci product which attempt\\nto support (1) are wordcruncher, fulcrum technology\\' ful-text and\\nbrs-search.  i know of no system which intrins support\\nrequir (2), though lbase perhap deserv a closer look, and a few\\noth oem product promis thi kind of flexibility.  it may be possible\\nto press ful-text or brs-search into servic sinc both have some\\nfacil for languag definition.  anoth promis product is

for\\ntextu study, or which could be enhanced/modifi in some fashion other\\nthan a bubble-gum hack.  it is not necessari that a candid possess\\nal of the abov features, but that the basic design be compat with\\nextend the system to support these function specs, and that the\\ndevelop be open to program enhancements.  ideally, such a system\\nwould work with cd-rom, though thi is not an absolut requirement.  i\\nwould like good lead of ani kind, but particularli product that could\\nb leased/licens under an oem agreement...for microcomputers, i should\\nadd.\\n\\n    thank in advanc to anyon

it would be a lot easier to read a group of\\nhumanist post at one time, or to sort the virtual reader repeatedly,\\na i suspect mani have to do\\n\\n(b) if you could autom a process to put an \"index\"/\"contents\" at the head\\nof each digest, that would be great...but not necessary.  if the exec to do\\nthi is not too bad, then perhap the index could indic line-numb at\\nwhich each new post begins.  most of have line-ori editor available,\\ni think, and could immedi \"goto\" select submissions, as dictat by\\nth subject-lin index at the top.\\n\\n(c) i agre that 12-28 humanist mailpiec per day is too much...i was\\nalreadi contempl download of the log onc per week if thi traffic\\nkeep up.  there is some chatter, in my judgment...i think everyon would\\nrespond to plea for self-control.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\ndo read the daili paper bother peopl as much as read the volumin mes\\nsag on the humanist?  whi not appli the same principl to\\nread the messag here as you use when read the daily:\\n1)read the headlines.  2)read the lead line of interesting\\nstories.  3)save a few memor item for your scrapbook.\\n4) use the rest to line your kittylitt box, or wipe\\nup the spill coffee.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\ni\\'d be in favour of digesting.

other suggestions), i must raise\\na person object to a tex-hax-styl index at the start.  the following\\nmay be of more interest to a psychologist than fellow humanists, but i\\ndo feel the point is worth make :-\\n\\nwhen i log-in of a morning, i am invari told \"you have  new mail\\nmessages\", where  is some posit integ gener less than 100,\\nand frequent less than 10.  depend on how busi i am, and one how\\nmani new messag are waiting, i then either (a) type \"directory\" (to mail),\\nif i am veri busy, or  is large, or (b) simpli read each mail message\\nin turn, if neither of the preced constraint obtains.  however, i derive\\nmor pleasur from style (b) of oper than style (a), in that each new\\nmail messag is a surprise, a present, of which i have no advanc knowledge.\\n\\nwhen i read tex-hax (which, like humanist, i field through the mrl/pfc\\n`bulletin\\' utility), i have no choice: whether i am busi or not, the\\nfirst thing i am present with is a list of the topic to be discussed\\nin that day\\' mailing.  now, i can tri not to read the list, if i want the\\nsurpris of each messag in turn, but that turn out to be surprisingly\\ndifficult, and much of the pleasur is lost, becaus each new messag is no\\nlong a total surprise.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ni\\'m sorri to do thi to willard, but i cast my vote for\\ncontinu anarchi as far as free rang of topic and\\nstyl (chattiness, etc) of submiss are concerned.  i\\ncan see that, if so mani peopl seem to feel strongli about\\nit, we do need to distribut in a more effici way, ie, in\\nbatch like texhax, whose editor doe not, as far as i can\\ntell, actual \\'edit\\' the submissions, except to post very\\nlong one to a fileserv and includ onli a short \\'pointer\\'\\nin the digest.  it\\' never taken me that long to comb through\\nmi messag in the morning, but i confess that i onli read\\nth one on subject of interest:  other get skim

easier to sift through a lot of small\\nmessag than to go through a huge biweekli \"digest\". it frustrat me to\\nhav to find space to save a 700-line digest becaus there is one 25-line\\nitem that interest me. i think that the key to humanist\\' continued\\nsuccess is self-restraint, rather than impos guidelines. i found the\\n\"postcard\" messag total inappropri to humanist, but i found an\\neasi solution: each time i saw a \"postcard\" subject, i delet the mail\\nimmediately. all told, i probabl wast 45 second (about the amount\\nof time you\\'r wast to read this). instead of spin off an array\\nof relat lists, it\\' far more natur for a group of humanist to move\\nto privat correspond as soon as an issu becom too specif or\\nesoter for \"mainstream\" humanist. for those of you who are afraid of\\ndelet or miss someth of importance, rememb that a copi of every\\nhumanist messag is archiv at utoronto (willard mention thi the other\\nday). if the listserv databas facil can be instal at utoronto, then we\\nwil have an effici way of search those archiv (that\\' a hint to\\nwillard and steve younker).\\nfor better or for worse, it seem that the topic most discuss on

university\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\ntwo thought about make humanist more humane.\\n\\n(1) offer humanist two way of receiv humanist information:\\n\\na. everything--al messages\\nb. onli messag in user-specifi interest areas.\\n\\ncurrently, everi humanist receiv everything. but whi not allow\\nhumanist to decid what they want to receive? for example, if\\nhumanist were restrict to one topic per messag (with no limit\\non the number of messag that could be sent), and if each\\nmessag had a sender-design topic header (i.e., hypertext,\\ntext retrieval, os/2), and if humanist had the _option_ of\\nask onli to receiv messag on certain topics, and if your\\nsoftwar is or could be made smart enough to recogn topical\\nhead and to send individu humanist onli those messag that\\nfal within their specifi topic areas, then those of us who\\nar not interest in learn about `postholes\\' or whi we should\\nlearn danish, for exampl (no offens meant!), would not have to\\nspend time read and/or print such messages. furthermore, if\\nhumanist had on-lin user-profil file that humanist could edit\\nto chang their specifi area of interest, then user could\\nfre updat or chang their specifi area of interest.\\n\\n(2) here is a more radic idea that doe _not preclude_\\ncontinu on with (1) a or ad (1) b. that is, (1) a & b and\\nthi idea, (2), could all be use concurrently. they\\'r not\\nmutu exclusive.\\n\\ninstead of the fileserv at utoronto send humanist messages\\nto humanists, whi not give humanist the _option_ of accessing\\nth utoronto fileserv for humanist messages. in other words,\\nthi would be a \"don\\'t-call-us, we\\'ll-call-you\" option.\\n\\nher is a modif of that idea that appeal to me. whi not\\nhav a _version_ of humanist that oper like a bulletin board\\nor like a dial-up conferenc system (e.g., caucus). that would\\nallow humanist to access a structur system in which messages\\nand inform were divid by topic. after log on to such a\\nsystem, humanist could select the topic area in which they\\nwish to read or post messages. each topic area could have an\\non-lin local or remot \"manager\" (pick ani title) who was\\nrespons for overse the content of the area(s) he or she\\nwa respons for. thi would take some of the work off of\\nwillard. i don\\'t believ such a system would diminish the\\nus of humanist to those who prefer receiv information\\nin a more structur and select fashion. and separating\\ndiscuss into topic area would, i believe, facilitate\\n_better_ discussions. it would help to keep them more focus and\\nmor structured, and it would allow humanist to see and interact\\nwith the whole discussion--from it incept to the\\npresent--instead of get a messag here and there, now and\\nthen on a given topic of interest and tri to save and file\\nsuch messag in a coher fashion, which is the way humanist\\nnow works.\\n\\nright now, humanist seem like a \"one-room\" discuss group that\\nha grown so larg that some particip are walk away\\nbecaus of the volum of inform they are be ask to\\nprocess--too mani voic talk about too mani thing all at the\\nsam time in one room. by have a version of humanist that\\nfunct as a \"multi-room\" set of somewhat more structured\\ndiscuss groups, and by allow humanist to move from \"room\"\\nto \"room,\" you might help end some of the frustrat of\\ninform overload without diminish the use of\\nhumanist. larg \"multi-room\" conferenc system like bix and\\nth confer on compuserv function as use sourc of\\ninform without inund their user with all sort of\\nstuff they may not be interest in. and humanist interest in\\n\"direct contact\" with other humanist can alway e-mail them\\non bitnet, netnorth, earn, etc.\\n\\ni hope thi is not just one more piec of \"junk mail\" that will\\nprecipit some humanist into write and ask to be removed\\nfrom the fileserver\\' list!\\n\\njohn\\n\\njohn j.

of\\nstandard.\\n\\nif you are curiou whi spanish is not use in thi country, the reason\\nshould be quit obvious.  whi did the french end up speak a dialect\\nof latin instead of gallic?  clearly, latin wa the prestig languag in\\nth western mediterranean at that time.  thi is not to say that latin\\ni better than gallic.  likewise, i am not make the absurd claim that\\nspanish cultur is \"lower\" in some sens than american.  what i am saying\\ni that we have a lot of poorly-educ spanish-speak peopl coming\\ninto thi countri whose dialect would not gener be use to emulate.\\nalso, they and their countri of origin, are often militarili and economic-\\n depend on the u.s., again reinforc the percept that they\\nshould be learn english rather then the reverse.\\n\\nthi is not an excus for the failur of american econom polici in\\ncentr and south america.  it is simpli an explan for whi spanish\\ni not well known.  i am sure that if mexico had a rich economy, was\\nproduc all kind of scholarli literature, and gener look like\\na desir culture, that american would learn it language.\\n\\nnow, a final word about the racial makeup of america.  indeed, it is\\ndiverse.  but the reason for our lack of divers in languag should be\\nobvious.  when my ancestor came over here, they were not rich folk.\\nso to work, they could not forc their nativ tongu on americans.  more-\\nover, onc here, they need a common languag with which to communicate\\nwith variou other ethnic groups, as well as with the natives.  english\\nbecam the natur choice.\\n\\nagain, if my ancestor (prussians, so watch out :-)) had come into a\\nstat like, say, czechoslovakia, which ha a german-speak \"area\", and\\nli near sever german-speak countries, they might have found it\\nmor use to retain their dialect.  they did not, and so natur they\\nlearn english.  they even gave up speak german in the home, since\\nthey could see no basic need for it; in fact, they felt strongli that the\\nchildren should be fulli prepar to integr into the mainstream of\\namerican culture.\\n\\nbut to return to the point, american humanists, in spite of the monolingual-\\n of their society, do find it use to know foreign languages.  and, in\\nspit of the extrem difficulti get exposur to these languag here,\\ngener learn them anyway.  in sum, your american correspond on the\\nhumanist do

\\n[mail on the subject of mail continu to trickl in, and i\\ncontinu to think about the problem some peopl are having\\nwith the volum of it. at the moment the two most reasonable\\nposs seem either to send out a few digest each\\nday sort roughli by subject or to send out one digest with\\neveryth in it. michael sperberg-mcqueen ha alreadi written\\nsoftwar that will clean up the sometim volumin

service\\nin which subscrib declar their interest in particular topic and\\nonli receiv mail on those topics. everyon will continu to receive\\neverything. i, for one, think that the charact and valu

of *storag space* requir to hold humanist mail cannot be\\nreduc except through editori censorship or self-control. the former\\ni refus to practic unless push to it by gross indenc -- not to\\nb expect here at ani rate; the latter is gener a good thing, i\\nsuppose, but as our number increas such control will becom more of a\\nthreat to creativ and inform expression.\\n \\nthe moral of thi stori are, then: (1) discuss onli one subject per\\nmessage; (2) be as clear and concis as possibl in your subject lines,\\nus a question mark if you\\'r ask for information, elimin it\\nif you\\'r

making\\neffici use of the eighth bit so that more charact could be accomodated,\\nmak it easi to strip a text of diacritics, and perhap make alphabetic\\nsort algorithm simpler.  but it ha great disadvantages.  it would need\\na fundament rewrit of mani editor and other program if the number of\\ncharact were no longer equal to the number of bytes.  wherea it would\\nne onli a minor chang to

to me the real problem is that the usual paradigm of\\nmail list doesn\\'t support the notion of *topics* of discussion.\\neven the arpa mail header standard doesn\\'t provid a \\'category\\'\\nfield, but onli \\'subject\\' (of course, it also doesn\\'t provid for\\npersons\\' name veri neatly, either...).\\n \\nif each user could easili throw away note *bi topic*, then the\\ndelug could be stemmed.  thi would also work if you had software\\nwhich could maintain inform on people\\' interests, and mail\\nthem onli what they wanted.  but that is a mess in term of\\ntheir keep your softwar updat as to their interests.\\n \\nhere\\' a proposal:\\n \\neveri \\'subject:\\' field must begin with a category, from a set of\\nact categori known to humanist at the time.  there is also\\na reserv categori \"newtopic\", which is alway active, and used\\nto propos a new topic of discussion.  the list of active\\ncategori can be distribut as a note from time to time.\\n \\ngiven a categori label on everi note, user with mailer can\\neasili skip past topic they do not care about, and simpl software\\ncan be written for other (like vm users), to delet note not\\nof interest (i\\'ll probabl write it for myself anyway, and will\\ndistribut it if so).\\n \\nexamples:\\n \\ni see these problems:\\n \\nfirst, categori name must be standardized.  one doesn\\'t want\\npeopl call the same topic \\'language\\', \\'langage\\', \\'ling\\', etc.\\nthi can be handl by a simpl exec you run befor mail out\\nthings, or by have an automat post machin return non-\\nconform mail to sender (which will get peopl to spell the\\ncategori right in a hurry, though they may not be happy).\\nth xedit \\'all\\' command (if you\\'r on vm) will hide all but the\\n\\'subject:\\' lines, so you could then review a day\\' note all on\\nat most a few screens, and normal ani oddbal categories, or\\nadd categori if they are omitted.\\n \\nsecond, categori sometim evolve, rather than spring forth.\\nthi is not a real problem; when ani categori grow too larg or\\ndiverse, either the moder or a particip can propos a\\nnewtopic.\\n \\nanoth advantag of thi method is that it is easi to track\\ndiscussions, and see what topic are hot.  also, it is easy\\nto retriev old mail on particular topics.\\n \\nto realli do thi right, one should allow dot or some other\\nsepar in categori

read\\nsever post relat to the same topic at the same time\\n \\n(b) i think it will help contributor focu their comment on current\\ntop (perhap think a littl harder about their contributions, or\\nposs contributions) and thu cut down on inan chit-chat\\n \\n(c) it reduc the humanist mail traffic on the network, in term of\\nreduc the number of mail pieces\\n \\n(d)it make save humanist contribut much easier, if we want to\\nsav discuss on select topics\\n \\n(e) it make ignor select topic much easier.\\n \\ni admit that i am on a vm/cm machin where i have to peek the reader\\nbefor i can do anyth to the mail, and that \"receive\" (or even\\n\"readcard\") get expens with so mani mail pieces.  but i suspect that\\nmost humanist are on vm...do you know?\\n \\nfinally, i had a discuss with nick deros about the idea of\\nintroduc \"topic\" as well as (more specific) \"subject\" where the\\ntaxonomi of \"topic\" would be enforced, but the \"subject\" specification\\ncould be flexible.  of course, vm mailer would still use \"subject\" line\\nfor what we mean by \"topic,\" but that isn\\'t fatal.  thi too would help\\nfocu humanist discussions, i think...which sometim seem a bit shallow\\notherwise.  nick contribut the horder exec, and i\\'ll bet other\\nhumanist would be will to contribut similar mail softwar for other\\nsystems.  in ani case, i like the greater organ

list by robin cover, malcolm brown and john j. hughes\\nfor text search and retriev program have all given me great pleasure\\n(imagin program with such features), some pain (reflect that\\nsuch

are\\nlistening!\\n \\nand on the off chanc that they are, here are my own two cents\\' worth:\\n \\nan ideal text retriev program should understand and help examine\\ntextu variation, whether from success authori drafts, successive\\nedit of a print work, diverg manuscript transmiss of a\\ntext, or revis of a text (e.g. in legal code or commentaries).\\n(thes are technic and correctli known as \\'text states\\', but i\\nwil refer to them as \\'manuscripts\\' becaus that\\' probabl easier\\nto follow.)\\n \\nunderstand and handl manuscript correctli means:\\n \\n1 each of the kind of search note by cover, brown, or hugh should\\nb available\\n    - for specifi manuscript (\"in ms c, find all occurr of\\n         \\'holmes\\' within one sentenc of \\'watson\\' ...\")\\n    - for all manuscript (\"in *any* ms, find ...\")\\n    - for some subset of the manuscript (\"find this, but onli in\\n         mss a, b, or c ...\")\\n \\nnote that the distanc between two word is no longer absolute, but a\\nfunct of the manuscript in which the distanc is measured.\\n \\n2 in browsing, the user should be abl to select ani manuscript as the\\nbasi for the display (\"show me thi passag in ms. a!  ... now in\\nms. b!\")\\n \\n3 in display hits, the program must obvious display the version\\nof the text that ha the hit.  (if ms. a ha \\'holmes\\' and \\'watson\\'\\ntogeth in thi sentence, but ms. b doesn\\'t, the display must be\\nbas on a, not b.)  where more than one ms. ha the same wording\\nfor a passage, that passag should be list as a hit onli once, and\\ndisplay accord to the \\'preferred\\' manuscript.  the user, of\\ncourse, get to say the order in which mss are to be preferred.\\nand should be abl to switch, within the \\'hit\\' window, to ani other ms.\\n \\n4 both for brows and for display of hits, the user should be abl to\\nrequest and see an apparatu criticu for the passag shown on the\\nscreen.  when the base manuscript chang (\"show me thi passag in\\nmanuscript k!\") the apparatus, of course, must chang too.  when the\\ntext window scrolls, of cours the apparatu scroll too.\\n \\n5 the user should be abl to specifi dynam which manuscripts\\nshould be includ in the apparatus.  extra credit:  the user can mark\\nspecif variant as interest or not interest (or with a variety\\nof flags:  lexical, orthographic, syntactic, metrical, ...) and have\\nvari includ or exclud from the visibl apparatu on that basis.\\n \\n6 in browsing, the user should be abl to open a parallel window with a\\ndiffer base manuscript, so that ms. a can be seen in one window and\\nms. b in the other.  apparatu should be avail in each window.  when\\non scrolls, the other should scroll, too.\\n \\n7 in addit to the search specifi by cover, brown, and hughes, the\\nus should be abl to search for manuscript variat of a specific\\n8 as a sideline, the program ought to be abl to gener list of\\nvari and variat of the sort develop by henri quentin and used\\nbi w. w. greg or vinton dearing, for analysi use other program and\\neventu for the gener of stemmata.  it would be nice if the\\nprogram could also be given a stemma and from it gener the text\\ndetermin by that stemma.  (indetermin passag highlighted, with\\naltern print below each other, for the editor to choose\\nbetween?)\\n \\ni should point out that some thing of thi kind can be done by the\\nprogram tustep, develop at tuebingen by wilhelm ott; i don\\'t know much\\nin detail becaus i have not use the program or had the chanc to read\\nit documentation.  unless i am much mistaken, however, tustep is\\nprincip batch-oriented, and i have been envis an interactive\\nprogram.\\n \\nsever program have been mention alreadi in thi discuss as able\\nto do at least some of the kind of search desired.  not mentioned\\nyet, though (i think) is arras, develop by john b. smith and now sold\\nbi conceptu tools, of chapel hill, nc.  while not yet the system of\\nour dreams, arra (which run on ibm system/370 machines, under tso\\nor vm/cms) will handl point 1-3, 5-7, 11-16, 19, 24, 38, 42, of\\njohn j. hughes\\' list.  not bad at all, on the whole, and cheap by\\ncomparison with most other mainfram software.  smith is work on\\na micro (rt-class machine) version that is even more elabor and\\nslick.\\n \\nbut i notic that all of thi discuss of text-retriev software\\nremains, as willard observ some month ago, within the world of\\nth text itself:  if not \\'new critical\\', then at least still\\n\\'text-immanent\\'.  and i wonder:  what desiderata would other add\\nto these lists?\\n \\nmichael sperberg-mcqueen, univers of illinoi at chicago\\n\\nfrom: willard mccarti srrj1@vaxa.york.ac.uk\\nsubject: comput for humanist at york, u.k.

experi in develop and teach cours in\\ncomput to humanists.  all who were actual teach such a course\\nbrought materi such as syllabi and assign to share.  i believe\\na collect of these materi still exist somewher in nanci ide\\'s\\ncloset, becaus our origin intent wa to begin a \"clearinghouse\"\\nfor materi relat to such courses.  unfortunately, we could not obtain\\nth fund for the clearinghouse, so it remain a dream.\\n \\nwe have produc the issu of chum 21(4) to which joe rudman made reference.\\nthat issu is a direct result of the vassar workshop.  it contain bob\\noakman\\' keynot address, joe rudman\\' excel survey and bibliography,\\nand articl by nanci ide and me about \"what\" we should teach (nancy) and\\n\"how\" we should teach it (me).\\n \\nthe confer schedul for 16-18 june 1988 at oberlin colleg in oberlin,\\nohio is also concern exclus with teach comput and the humanities\\ncourses.  we will have a keynot address by joe rudman, four panel devoted\\nto differ aspect of the subject, and over 30 contribut paper by\\nscholar from the unit state and canada who are teach comput to\\nstud in all differ branch of the humanities.  the paper include\\nteach student in music, languag and literature, translation, history,\\nand philosophy, among other subjects.\\n \\nit is my hope that the paper will appear in a formal proceedings, together\\nwith materi gather at the vassar workshop and at thi conference.  i am\\ncurr work on realiz that hope.\\n \\ni invit all of you who are teach in thi field to share your experiences\\nwith the rest of us via humanist and to join us at oberlin in june.  to be\\nput on the confer mail list, send a messag to dr. roberta russell\\nat oberlin (prussell@oberlin).\\n \\n                              bob tannenbaum

queri in humanist about nota bene\\' hebrew\\nversion. as we have had quit a lot of experi with that here at\\nport institute, tel aviv university, here is a piec of brief\\ninformation:\\n \\n1. there is a beta version of hebrew for nota bene\\' multilingual\\nsupplement. thi version is made for american scholar who have no\\nhebrew chip in their printer (nor in their computers, but the latter\\ncan be easili solv with hercul graphic plu card). it can print\\nvoc plu other massoret stuff. it probabl can provide\\neveryth a biblic scholar in america might need for his/her\\nscholarli work (especi sinc greek is avail too).\\n \\n2. thi version is not adequ for isra and other peopl using\\nhebrew as a *primary* language, becaus the hebrew alphabet ha been\\nimpos on variou ascii posit that are not compat with those\\nus in israel. sinc ibm peopl have impos hebrew on ascii 128-\\n154, onc you chang that you cannot be compat with ani other\\nloc programs, and that is not accept to us.\\n \\nfor thi reason, dragonfli have provid us with a so call \"chip\\nversion\", intend for peopl who have access to hardwar adapt to\\nhebrew comput and print (the regular hardwar sold in this\\ncountry). the beta version origin use print mode to go over\\nfrom hebrew to latin (allow both push mode and regular write of\\nboth direct within one file). i have temporarili chang that to\\nimpos languag (direction) chang on pitch (e.g., latin is pt12\\nwhile hebrew is pt112 etc.; lr0 and lr1 respect control the\\nprimary/major direction).\\n \\ni have avoid the sl mode and return complet to regular nota\\nbene. the same solut actual work veri well with the new 3.0\\nversion. you just need a differ printer tabl (not provid by\\ndragonfly) and impos the hebrew letter on the capslock key.\\n \\n3. however, we still wait for a new hebrew version, sinc there are\\nsom more problem to solve: in my custom version, each time you\\nchang direct you also must press/depress capslock (where the\\nhebrew letter are located). perhap a quicker solut eventually\\ncan be found (though i do not consid that ani major issue).\\nmoreover, i have heard that instead of the somewhat awkward modes\\nwith number (hebrew=md71, hebrew underline=md65 etc.) there will be\\nmor easili memoriz code (mdhm or mdhu probably).\\n \\n4. all version carri out most of the regular function of nota bene.\\nequ width column howev are a bit shaki if you use more than 2;\\nnewspap column won\\'t work. textbase, database, mailmerg will all\\nwork with certain minor extra step (you can now get a full\\nvocabulari of a hebrew text sinc the new textbas fulli recognizes\\nth high-bit ascii without transform it to low-bit ascii\\nequival as it use to do before); accumul of bibliographies\\nwork perfectli all right; index and tabl of content work all\\nright, but for the moment you must run a program i have written to\\ntransform all the *numbers* to \"left-right\" direction, sinc they come\\nout \"right-left\" (21 instead of 12 etc.).\\n \\nif you are interest in more details, report on problem and other\\nsuggestions, i will shortli put on listserv@taunivm a document based\\non my previou memo to dragonfli peopl about the hebrew version.\\nbut no doubt thi is the most power real softwar packag for\\nhebrew and multilingu writing. but if all you need is onli some\\nword in hebrew insert in some text, or just quotations, i am not\\nsur you should bother, unless you are use nota bene anyway.\\n \\n[editor\\' note: thi file, notaben review, is on our file-server.]\\n

they are avail right now on the listserve.

a good speller and a thesaurus. thi wa a\\nclear cut advantage, but wordperfect had to develop it becaus not\\nb a pure ascii program, it would have difficulti in interacting\\nwith extran speller and thesauri. nota bene on the other hand\\ncould afford to postpon develop it own speller/thesauru because\\nal speller and thesauri can be use with it, includ turbo\\nlightning. sinc you can load ani program (software) on top of nota\\nben (that is, without exit nota bene), it is also veri easi and\\npract to use non memory-resid speller then return to nota\\nben in no time.\\n    recently, version 3.0 of nota bene got fabul speller and\\nthesaurus. pc-magazin enthusiast describ some time ago\\nxywrite\\' thesauru and spell checker, which it consid to be\\nfar superior to anyth for the moment avail on the market.\\nthes have been now made avail to nota bene\\' user with some\\nremark enhanc (like the auto-replac write mode). so even\\nthi gap between the program ha been overbridg to the clear\\nadvantag of nota bene.\\n \\n    4. if we compar nota bene in toto to wordperfect, the total\\nwordperfect would equal one third of nota bene. it would therefor be\\nfair and adequ to compar onli thi portion, which is mainli the\\nwordprocess featur of both.\\n \\n    let me therefor discuss some of the programs\\' respective\\nwordprocess features:\\n \\n    1. speed\\n    i find it veri strang to read your colleague\\' word about\\nwordperfect be a faster program than nota bene. nota bene\\'s\\nwordprocessor is basic enlarg xy-write. and xy-write, the\\noffici wordprocessor of pc-magazin sinc two year (see pc-\\nmagazin vol.6 no 10 [may 26 1987], p. 220), ha won the recognition\\nand acclaim of all expert in the field for be the fastest program\\non the market. (there are mani refer to the \"blaze speed\" of\\nxy-write/nota bene. see quot article, p. 219.)\\n    (to scroll from begin to end of a long file takes\\nconsider less than half the time in nb than in wp and other\\nfunct are similar.  moreover, cursor movement, delet etc. in\\nnb can be done by letter, word, phrase, sentence, paragraph. in wp as\\nof version 4.1 onli word level function were avail , and even\\nthat onli for cursor movement and forward delet if i am not\\nmistaken.)\\n \\n    2. wysiwyg and desktop publishing.\\n    it is not true that wordperfect is more wysiwyg than nota bene.\\nand nota bene is ahead of ani other wordprocessor for desktop\\npublishing.\\n \\n    wp is no more wysiwyg than nb. in nb bold is shown as bold,\\nunderlin as underline. and line-break appear where they will print.\\nin nb one see the delta which indic where format command have\\nbeen place precisely, so that one can edit the format commands\\ndirectly, a process which is extraordinarili difficult in wp. one\\nmust enter there a reveal code mode in which the cursor move very\\nsluggishly, and even then onli one or two line at a time can be\\nseen. moreover, one cannot edit the valu of format commands\\ndirectly, but must eras the exist one and reenter new one from\\nth menu.\\n    finally, if one want in nb to see the document with true spacing\\nand with the delta suppressed, these mode are onli a key-stroke\\naway; moreover, they can be made default as well. toggl between\\nthes mode and the regular mode is a matter of a keystroke. it is\\ntru that wp show on screen page breaks, which one must do review\\nmod to see in nb, and thi is a distinct advantag to wp; however,\\nit is at the cost of sever reduc scroll speed in wp. nb offers\\ny a page-lin mode, which tell you veri quickli where there are\\npag break as well.\\n    further, it is simpli not true that one requir a hercul card\\nto access extend charact in nb. these are fulli accessible, and\\nif you wish, you can also put them not where nb had but where you\\nwould like them to be. the hercul card or ega is onli requir for\\nspeci languag whose charact are unavail on a chip such as\\nhebrew with vocalization, greek, or cyrillic. wp cannot access such\\ndownload charact set at all at present. so nb not onli ha a\\nbett access to the extend charact but ha access to downloaded\\ncharact which are inaccess at all in wp.\\n \\n    as for desktop publishing, \"so mani profession writer make use\\nof xywrite\\' abil to gener pure ascii files, which can be\\nhand directli to a typesetter, that stay ahead of the pack here\\nvirtu assur continu preemin for xywrite\" (pc-magazine,\\nvol. 6 no 10:219).\\n    for more about nota bene\\' superior as a desktop wordprocessor\\nse page 220 of articl quot above.\\n \\n    in a special review about \"the desktop-publish phenomenon\" by\\njohn w. seybold (byte, vol. 12 no 5 [may 1987]:149-166), it is stated\\nthat:\\n \\n        \"a a microcomputer-bas text gener for composition\\n        systems, xywrit ha no competitors. xywrite\\' compatibility\\n        with almost everi other system in the composition-systems\\n        market ha made it the most popular text process package\\n        for microcomput in the publish industry. it ha become\\n        the program of choic for peopl in the composit business\\n        and is commonli use to emul the edit function of\\n        larg editori system such as atex...\" (p. 164, 166).\\n \\n    on the whole, layout featur of nota bene are far superior to\\nwordperfect\\'s, as you can infer from the descript in pc-magazine.\\nnota bene/xy-writ fantast invent of the command hidden in\\ndelta just allow an incred flexibl with layouting. you can\\nnot onli shape the document you like, but you can easili see your\\nhidden command ani time (without get a preview).\\n \\n    3. sorting\\n    sort is an extrem advanc featur in nota bene, and has\\nbeen even further enhanc in version 3.0 (see my document  on that\\nvers in notabene@taunivm). you can sort a file the way do does,\\nbut in contradistinct to dos, you have far better control of the\\nparameters. for instance, you can decid what order sort will take\\nplac by constru variou \"sort tables\". thi mean that even\\nnon-english languag materi can be sort correctli and that if you\\nwish, upper and lower case would be treat equal (unlik in dos).\\nmoreover, you can define, within a file, ani number of line that\\nsort them in a split of a second.\\n    among the most ingenu sort option is the one allow you\\nto sort materi without actual alter anyth in file. for\\ninstance, if you have a list of address where each address begins\\nwith \"mrs. and mr....\", you can put into a hidden delta the item\\naccord to which you want sort to take place (like a family\\nname). (and i have written a program in nota bene which carri out\\nthi oper automatically.)\\n \\n    4. printer and charact set(s) customization\\n    there is not anyth like nota bene\\' printer and character\\nt in wordperfect, allow you to custom complic matters\\nquickli and in an incred versatil way. sinc printer tabl are\\nopen to modifications, you can have control of a lot of features\\ninvolv with the computer-print communication. for instance, you\\ncan decid how a certain font or print mode will actual print\\n(e.g., underlin as italics, bold revers as enlarg or whatever).\\n    charact tabl allow high flexibl with printwheels, ascii\\nwrit and automat transliterations.\\n \\n    5. automat caps\\n    there isn\\'t anyth like nota bene\\' automat capit at\\nth begin of sentenc in wordperfect. thi simpl yet ingenuous\\nfeatur save you at least 25% of type time and mistakes.\\n \\n    6. automat numbering\\n    i am not awar of the exist of 10 level of automat number-\\ning, the shape of which can be control by few deltas, in wordper-\\nfect. (that is, you can chang number to letter or roman number in\\nno time, even after have written the automat numbers.)\\n \\n    7. cross-referenc and multipl cross referencing\\n    i do not think wordperfect ha got ani cross-referenc fea-\\ntures. in nota bene you can refer to number of footnote, page number\\nor section number. anybodi in our field know veri well how many\\ntedi hour of hard drudgeri are thu saved! and\\n \\n        \"better still, if you like to creat separ document for\\n        differ chapter that have subdivis that are numbered,\\n        but you want to chain-print them, the number refer can\\n        be made conditional, so that they will be ignor when\\n        includ in a larger print chain but display if that docu-\\n        ment is handl alone\" (pc-magazin 6, 10:220).\\n \\n    8. write in columns\\n    i am not awar of wordperfect\\' column features, but as far as i\\nhav work with it, i do not recal it ha the capac of writing\\nequal-width column (far better than tab for mani documents, such as\\nprogram of conferences). as for newspap columns, i don\\'t think\\nthey work as easili in wordperfect, sinc with nota bene you can\\neith pre-decid to write that way or insert the necessari deltas\\npost factum. (i am not sure of the number of column either; in nota\\nben you can write 6 such snake columns.)\\n \\n    9. \"foreign\" charact and \"foreign language\" versions\\n    i doubt that wordperfect can so freeli accommod \"non-english\"\\n(or \"foreign\"), as the american call them, characters. nota bene\\nsimpli allow you to put those anywher you like on it keyboards\\nplu you have full access to ascii wherev you are. for multilingual\\nwrit thi is a great relief.\\n \\n    moreover, nota bene ha develop a veri advanc hebrew version,\\nstil  experiment but alreadi highli advanced, more than ani extant\\nhebrew wordprocessor (i have been work with it for some time).\\nrussian and greek follow suit (these are not as complic as\\nhebrew). sinc you can access ani download charact and use\\ncharact tabl freely, other non-european languag can also be\\nwritten. wordperfect is not even interested, so it seems, in develop-\\n anyth for hebrew or other languages.\\n \\n    10. the open natur of nota bene is on the whole far more\\nsophist than anyth on the market. you may work either with\\nor without menus/help screens, while with wordperfect you are com-\\npel to go through them for quit rudimentari matter (such as\\ncopi or moving). you can custom mani default (some of which do\\nnot even exist in wordperfect: turn backup option on/off; have a\\nprompt befor eras a file; chang the cursor from blink to\\nnon-blink and a lot more) in a matter of seconds.\\n \\n    11. variou featur that seem to be lack in wordperfect\\n \\n    the follow featur seem complet absent from wordperfect\\n(pleas ask your friend to correct me where i am wrong):\\n    11.1. append (rather than merging) a file to anoth file\\n(without actual enter it), or portion of a file to some other\\nfile.\\n    11.2. call a file from ani subdirectori then saving/stor it\\nto that directori without go to it.\\n    11.3. find (through \"find\" command) ani file on hard disk then\\ncal it to screen without go to actual directory\\n    11.4. write hidden prompt anywher in file then access them\\nquickly. (i believ wordperfect 4.2 now introduc someth similar\\nto that.)\\n    11.5. 3 set of footnot plu endnotes, with call number either\\nwith arabic, roman or latin number system, plu ani sign (asterisk\\nor no sign at all).\\n    11.6. 9 windows, full, split horizontal, split vertic or all\\ncombined. easi and fast movement between windows, copying/moving\\netc. (see prais of inter-window movement in the said article, p.\\n219.)\\n    11.7. automat hyphenation, fulli customiz plu an open dic-\\ntionari of except for both english and ani other language.\\n    11.8. better method for print mode (underlin etc.) than any\\noth wordprocessor\\'s, sinc these can be changed/abolished/searched\\nin one command.\\n    11.9. much stronger (and of cours quicker!) search/search back/\\nchange/chang invisible/chang for onli upper or lower case/etc.\\noperations.\\n    11.10. multipl search on whole diskettes/subdirectories.\\n    11.11. enlarg directori (with desir number of line from\\nbegin of file).\\n    11.12. full control of print type and font from file (with\\ndeltas), includ mixtur of pitch and proport vertic and\\nhorizont space (nota bene calcul the screen in tenth-of-an-\\ninch unit rather than in number-of-characters).\\n    11.13. chain print with sequential/non-sequenti numbering.\\n \\n    12. clumsi function in wp\\n    mani wordprocess function are veri clumsi in wordperfect. i\\nadmit i have not work with 4.2, but as far as i have read, 4.2 has\\nnot dramat chang 4.1.\\n    for instance, to move a passag from one place to another. in wp\\nyou press alt f4 to begin defining, then move the cursor by word to\\nth end of the paragraph. then ctrl f4, and you get a menu, where you\\nchoos the option cut, then move the cursor to insert point, press\\nctrl f4 again and then choos the insert function from the menu.\\nin nb, you defin the paragraph with one stroke, move the cursor to\\ninsert point, and press gray minus. to chang footnot to endnote\\nin wp you must write a macro with about 8 step and run it for each\\nnote. of course, you can autom thi process, but it take several\\nsecond for each individu note. in nb you add two format commands\\n(deltas).\\n \\n \\n    13. wordperfect\\' clumsi macro vs. nota bene customizable\\n        keyboard and uniqu program language\\n    wordperfect allow write macro for ad necessari functions.\\nif you read a lengthi articl about thi in pc-magazin ( ) while you\\nar alreadi familiar with nota bene\\' custom and programming\\nposs you are definit astound by the clumsi and\\nrudimentari natur of these \"macros\". such results, and far better\\nones, can be achiev most elegantli and easili in nota bene by\\neith custom the keyboard, which is a smooth and pain opera-\\ntion, or by write programs, small or large. if you take my file of\\nprogram i have written for nota bene, you will be abl to fully\\nappreci the difference. besides, some of the macro suggest in\\nthat articl are alreadi built-in featur in nota bene.\\n    an interest exchang in pc-magazin shed some real light on\\nth matter of macro in wp. dave tocu from rockville, maryland\\nwrites:\\n \\n        one drawback to wordperfect macro is that the macro files\\n        must live in either the current directori or the same direc-\\n        tori as wp.exe. but sinc i have 130 macros, i would like to\\n        keep them in their own subdirectory.\\n    the editor of thi section, m. david stone, reacts:\\n \\n        ...mi own prefer with wordperfect is to ignor the macro\\n        featur and use superkey, prokey, or some other keyboard\\n        redefinit util instead. these program elimin the\\n        clutter of macro file by put all wordperfect macro in a\\n        singl file. they also let you edit the macros, even without\\n        the wordperfect library. prokey also permit name mac-\\n        ros.(pc-magazine, vol. 16 no. 12, june 23, 1987:365.

 b) the interest of the user - most user have no\\ninterest in the special activ of text analysi or even data\\nwillard ha ask us, in the context of the word processing\\ndiscussion, what make good softwar good.  one import aspect for\\nm is that the softwar should offer flexibl of interfac for the\\nusers.  thi mean that the novic should have comfort prompt and\\nmenus, and the expert should be abl to get where she or he wants\\nquickli without have to fiddl with the same stuff the novic does.\\na second import aspect for me is that the differ part of the\\nsoftwar packag should be well integrated.\\n \\nmi second \"import aspect\" mean that i have littl patienc for\\nword process packag that have separ edit and\\nformatting/print programs.  one doesn\\'t need absolut wysiwyg, but\\nsom aspect of wysiwyg can save a person a lot of time and paper.\\nfrom the computer\\' point of view, of course, edit and print are\\nsepar functions.  but thi is 1988 and we should be beyond the\\nstag of have softwar that is written from the computer\\' point of\\nview.  an integr environ is a much more pleasant place to\\nwork, in my opinion.\\n \\nmi first \"import aspect\" bring me to my favourit word processing\\npackage, hitherto not mention in the discussion.  lest peopl think\\nthat word perfect and nota bene are alon in the ms-do field, do not\\nforget microsoft word version 4. besid be essenti wsyiwyg and\\nmor or less integr in all it part (take care of my second\\n\"import aspect\"), it offer the user three way to do everything\\nth power user, of course, doe not need all that help.  for him or\\nher, there are multipl options.  each function key ha four meanings\\n(which can be re-assign under version 4) in combin with shift,\\ncontrol, and alt keys.  there are macros, which can be \"recorded\"\\nsimpli by type what you want to do, or which can be program if\\non should have need for condit branch or storag of valu in\\nvari while the macro executes.  finally, there is the mouse,\\nwhich offer extrem easi way to select and format text, to split\\nwindow (i often have three or more window open), to move through the\\ndocument, or even to oper the menu if you so choose.\\n \\nthere are of cours flaws.  the spell checker is not all that well\\nintegr into the packag (although it is clearli better than some:\\nat least it doe not requir you to go search through the text for\\n\\'#\\' symbol mark incorrect words, or someth like that!). the\\nprint driver are hard to custom - they were clearli designed\\nwith programm in mind rather than \"lay\" users.  fortunately, they\\nar at least well documented.\\n \\non the posit side onc again, the outlin processor is fabulously\\nintegrated.  the thesauru is much better integr than the spell\\nchecker\\' \"lookup\" feature. the style sheet are a concept that i\\nhaven\\'t seen on ani other packag in quit thi way, and now i don\\'t\\nknow how i could get along without them.  there is no messi fiddling\\naround with make format code visibl and invisible, as in word\\nperfect.\\n \\nm word fit me well, with my high rate for integr and\\nflexibility.  from what i have seen, nota bene will need one or two\\nmor major version releas befor i would consid switching\\n(although i do envi nb\\' databas features).  and ms word is no worse\\noff than word perfect when it come to use non-roman font (i use\\nth turbofont package).  the review i\\'v read of ms word agre with\\nmi experience, that ani discuss which includ wp and nb must also\\ninclud ms word version 4, sinc it word process featur and\\npow are comparable.\\n \\nsterl bjorndahl\\nbjorndas@clargrad (bitnet)\\n\\nfrom: willard mccarti willard mccarti \"patrick w. conner\"              willard mccarti \"patrick w. conner\"              \\nsubject: wordprocessor & mind (108)the wither away of the differences?wordprocessor & mind (159)the wither away of the differences?wordprocessor & mind (159)\\ndate: sat, 02 apr 88 17:27:00 est1 april 1988saturday, 2 apr 1988 04:05:32 est\\nx-humanist: vol. 1 num. 1036 (1036)\\n\\n(1)   date:      1 april 1988                                (66 lines)\\n(2)   date:      saturday, 2 apr 1988 04:05:32 est           (24 lines)\\n(1) --------------------------------------------------------------------\\nif i understand him correctly, norman zacour ha argu that\\ncompar wordprocessor is not like to get us anywhere, since\\na these program develop their differ will tend to\\ndisappear. `everyth that progress must converge.\\' hmm.\\nwhether or not thi is someth devoutli to be wished,\\nmi experi with other people\\' softwar suggest very\\nstrongli that it is simpli not true.\\n \\nthe whole point of talk about `the mind in the software\\' is\\nthat programs, especi highli complex ones, have a discernible\\nunderli structure, which i am want to call a `mentality\\'.\\nornithologist say that crows, for example, can identify\\nparticular human be no matter what kind of disguis they put\\non;

and\\nin my experi it is veri seldom true that a program changes\\nfundament from version to version. there\\' a highli pragmatic\\nreason for constanc of thi sort: it\\' veri expens to rework\\nrad the fundament of a complex program, wherea if the\\nprogram ha been well design new featur won\\'t be terribly\\ndifficult to add. slow routin can be rewritten in assembler,\\nnew algorithm adopt for do thi or that, but the basic ways\\nof the program will tend to remain constant. then, too, a\\nsuccess program will have a commit group of user who for\\nwhatev reason *like* those basic way and would be upset to\\nse them change. how peopl complain when even a singl keystroke\\ni redefined!\\n \\nfor the softwar design the principl of constanc would seem\\nto have an import consequence. forgiv me if thi is obvious,\\nbut isn\\'t it true that initi decis about a program are\\ncruci to it eventu outcome? anoth question spring to\\nto my mind a softwar review that doe not attempt to verbalize\\nth mental of a program is not worth reading. should we not\\ndemand from softwar review standard compar to those we\\nexpect of book reviews? i want to know what the author is get at\\nand how -- not just the topics.\\n \\ni realiz that argument over which wordprocessor is best are apt to\\nadd littl to our knowledg about anyth except each other\\'s\\npassions. as zacour said, the believ is driven to convert the\\ninfidel, and few believ see ani reason whi they should\\nunderstand the infidel\\' scripture.

\\'mentality\\' is both too weak and too strong?  it is too strong in\\npresuppos that the individu person of the softwar could be reflected\\nbi a piec of softwar just as it could by a piec of art or literature.  it is\\ntoo weak in not discrimin among the variou domain that guid software\\ndevelopment.\\n \\n \\n \\n2 the develop of educ softwar is guid by such domain as software\\nengineering--\\'structur design\\'--curriculum theori and design--\\'individualized\\ninstruction\\'--and cognit psychology--\\'ment models\\', \\'expert strategies\\'.\\nsimilarly, in the design of comput languages, theori of what a computer\\nprogram is and does, guid their development.   \\'a program=data+algorithms\\'\\nguid the develop of pascal.\\n \\n3 the more appropri question seem to be:  what theori and domain are\\nmost relev for specif applications?  in word processing, what theories\\nhav guid the develop of variou softwar systems?\\n \\n   i have the suspicion that word process packages, for the most part, grew\\nout of attempt to improv clumsi main-fram line editor packages.  line\\neditors, originally, serv the function of edit program instruct rather\\nthan compos literari products.  peopl use these program editors, beyond\\ntheir origin purpos and design,  to write notes, and then tri to write\\nessays.  soon design ad variou tool to help them achiev these\\nsecondari use of line editor as main goals--such as variou supplementary\\ncommand for format hard copy.  somewher along the line, developers\\ndecid to make \\'user interface\\' a bit more \\'friendly\\' by ad a \\'screen\\'\\nedit mode on top of the origin line editor.  here is where word processors\\nspeci from the origin line-editor ancestor:  the vision of edit text,\\nnot \\'line-by-line\\', but \\'screen-by-screen\\'.  of course, some of the precursor\\nel remain, such as odd command for drive hard copy.\\n \\n   unlik most other software, word process packag develop in an\\nevolutionari manner as a by product.  theori of softwar design, of the\\nnatur of the write process, onli came late on the scene to guid current\\nmodif of pre-exist structures.   indeed, the understand of the\\nwrit process will onli now be approach that we have word processor as an\\naltern to the technolog of pen+paper.  furthermore, it is the use of\\nfull-screen functions, and of \\'windowing\\', that will most help us to understand\\nth underli mental process use in write and thinking, and that will\\nguid the develop of word/text processing.  sinc nowadays, most packages\\nprovid for scholari desiderata such as creat index and foot notes, the\\nlead edg will be abiltiy to produc public qualiti text (\\'desk-top\\npublishing\\'), wsiwyg, mutlipl windowing, and \\'importability/exportability\\'\\nbetween text process and graphic processing, and more generally: the\\ndist between the intermedi process of composing/edit with a computer\\nand the desir final product.   for instance, lotu manuscript ha a\\nstructur  edit mode where text can be creat and edit by (numeric)\\nsection/sub-section.  thi is veri close to the type of final product i mostly\\n4 so, what desiderata should we present to word processor developers?\\n \\n   in general:  how close is the intermedi task of edit text on the\\nscreen to-- 1)the variou final product we want to produc (structur texts,\\nintegr text and graphics, fanci fonts..) and; 2)the process we use in\\nthink with write (zoom to the most abstract structur and flipping\\namong parallel text in differ

2.03) for some three month now.  we have\\nmad it through the mound of technici inform accompanying\\nth packag as well as the softwar itself. we feel that we now\\ncan share with you some of our preliminari observations.\\n \\nmost important, ms window is a forward albeit diagon step in the\\nright direction.  we can understand whi appl is sue microsoft.\\n(question: whi didn\\'t xerox sue apple?)    ms window 2.03 seems\\nto be a polish and rel stabl product with no significant\\nbugs.\\n \\nlist of posit comments:\\n \\n1. the graphic interfac is well-design and powerful.  we have\\nbeen run window on a ps/2 (model 60), and speed of display is\\ncompar to earli macintosh.\\n \\n2. it is good that they have given us a full diskett of sampl programs\\nto use and studi sinc program in the window environ is\\nunlik normal do programming.

[mac mice\\nhav onli one button, not \"three appar identical\" ones]  and contrari to\\nth talk about ideographs, the great bulk of macintosh use (in my experience)\\ndo *not* involv icons.  the interfac is graphic-based, true, but the icons\\nar larg restrict to the \"desktop\" or top-level directory; onc an\\nappl is launched, veri littl actual icon use usual occurs.  the\\nadvantag of the mouse/window/pull-down (or pop-up) menu interface, in my view,\\ni that it permit the beginn to use the menus, where all the command are\\nlaid out in full view, and progress to use the keyboard equivalents, of which\\na multipli- citi are often provided, as experi is gained.  thi mean a\\nsharpli reduc relianc on the manual, which cut the loss of time which\\nentail by go to the manual, find the appropri passage, and tri to\\nunderstand what the manual-writ ha written.\\ni think philip\\' comments, however, point up someth said earlier by jeffrey\\ngillett (i think), which is that there is a class of sophisticated, knowledge-\\nable, intellig comput user who simpli do not find the mouse-bas inter-\\nfac attract or useful.  often these people, when i encount them, seem to\\nb comput professionals: system managers, unix gurus, people\\nwith a storehous of proprietari knowledg which they have spent\\ntim acquir and which is valuabl to them and to others.\\noften, i think, the  \"mac/windows\" interfac is\\nuncongeni to them *because* it divorc them from the command line and from\\nth heart of the machin which they know so intimately.  as our local \"micro-\\ncomput specialist\" said, \"i do not think faculti will want macintosh\\ncomputers, becaus on the macintosh you cannot have direct access to the oper-\\n system.\"\\ni must emphas that i most sure do not want to start some pointless flame\\nwar about vms/unix/mac/do interfaces: isn\\'t the interest question here\\nprecis the debat about whi some of us prefer one interfac to such a high\\ndegree, and the subsidiari question of whi we feel so strongli about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------\\ni just read 62 page of humanist and have final caught up with the\\nwp/softwar mind debate,  concern which i wish to make four

he is\\ncal vincent, and perform a sterl job in keep the coffe milk cold,\\nand cool bottl of wine for special occasions. vincent (vf@uk.ac.soton.cm)\\noften contribut to the department bulletin board, send occasion mail,\\nand gener keep a live look out on our affairs. vinc is not yet on the\\npayrol, but we are work on get him elect to the univers senate.\\n(thi is all true). but as for wp:\\n \\na) the frenet notaben adul neglect the fact that, in thi countri at\\nleast, the *support* for nota bene from the distributor is laughable. i chose\\nmi wash machin on the reput of the supplier for backup, not for\\nfeatur - if i had to choos a word-processor (god forbid!), i\\'d buy\\nmicrosoft word becaus i trust microsoft to stand by me. ok, i know on that\\nargu i\\'d buy ibm mainframes, but i hope the point is taken about support.\\n \\nb) the mind-in-the-softwar - willard say that software, onc designed,\\nremain faith to the initi concept. yes, but what about softwar designed\\nto meet a prescrib task? take databas - if (when?) the iso standard for\\nsql is adopted, will we be abl to tell the differ between oracle, db2 and\\ningres? or c compil - as someon said, the spirit of c is a personality\\nthing, but the differ between microsoft and borland isn\\'t. to pursu that,\\nonc one accept the idea of the integr compil a la borland, you can\\'t\\nreal do much about it. i suspect also that willard is not a macman; i take\\nhi point about the deviou mind of the notaben creator be visibl still,\\nbut would it be on a mac? i don\\'t see much person in mac program (with\\nth honour except of illustrator). mayb other do.\\n \\nc) de rose state the case against wysiwyg more eloqu than i can; i\\'d go\\nal the way with him and the others, and further, to say that academic\\nword-process is a dead-end which we will soon see the death of, thank god.\\nthere\\' text-processing, prepar materi for electron public (from\\nbb and mail to gener markup for databas and printing) and there\\'s\\ncomputer-assist design (of which \\'dtp\\' design of leaflet for paper printing\\ni a a subset). the use of a comput as typerwrit for letters, memo and\\nth like (which is all that wp program are ani good for) should wither away,\\ni hope. even letter fall better into the gener markup game - a reversion\\nto the \\'take a letter, miss jones, and don\\'t bother

               new o project\\n \\n     in 1984, for the 100th anniversari of the public of the\\nlett \"a,\" oxford univers press announc it intent to\\ncomputer the oed, put the 12-volum text and the 4-volume\\nsuppl into machine-read form by the end of 1986, and\\nthen publish an integr o by 1989.  at the time, this\\nseem like scienc fiction, but in fact, at the moment, the\\nproject is right on schedule.\\n     the fourth volum of the supplement wa publish in 1986,\\nand almost at the same time the machine-read text of the 12\\nvolum of the o and the 4-volum  supplement had been\\ninputted. thi wa accomplish by the intern computaprint\\ncorpor (icc) of fort washington, pa., between januari 1985\\nand june 1986.\\n     the text contain almost half a million definitions\\nillustr by two and a half million quotations.  the icc had\\ninput some 350 million print charact at less than the\\ncontractu rate of 7 error or less in 10,000 keystrokes--in the\\nlatt batch a rate of 4 error or less wa regularli achieved.\\nsinc then, the text ha been proofread by oup, and murray\\'s\\nnot of pronunci ha been convert into the\\nintern phonet alphabet.\\n     by last summer, oup had complet the automat integration\\nof the 4-volum supplement into the bodi of the l2-volum o and\\nmad the first pass of the cross-referenc system.  the editors\\nar now work on the manual integr of the supplement into\\nth oed, that is, the 20 per cent by volum that could not be\\ndon automatically.\\n     to assist the editor in the integr of the text, the\\noup comput group ha develop a computer edit system,\\nwhos name tell it all:  oxford english dictionari integration,\\nproofing, and updat system, or oedipus.  so far there are no\\nsign of a tragic conclusion.\\n     indeed, the new o comput system ha alreadi won the\\nbritish comput societi applic award for 1987 for its\\ninnov use of the computer.  oedipu as part of thi system\\nprovid a mean of examin and correct the text of the\\ndictionari on comput screens.  it allow the editor not only\\nto insert new word into the dictionari but to enter the editors\\'\\nadditions, corrections, insertions, delet at ani point within\\nan entry.  as thi is be done, it is sent to the typesetters\\nand proofread again, after which further correct are made.\\n     in decemb 1987, oup and bowker and tri-star made available\\nth text of the unintegr 12-volum o produc by icc on two\\ncd-rom disks, a-n and o-p, cost about $1250 for the set with\\ndocumentation.  the entir dictionari could have fit onto one\\ndisk, but ad index and invert file requir anoth disk\\nto be used.  bowker and tri-star had devis a system that allows\\nth user to make inquiri concern the data store on the cd-\\nrom.  the program divid the screen into three windows: the top\\nfor queri and field, the middl for view the result of a\\nsearch, and the bottom for identifi function keys. the text\\ncan be search veri quickli and easili on eight field derived\\nfrom the approxim forti field found in the dictionary\\nentries.  these includ lemma, etymology, sense, and label (part\\nof speech, usage, special language), and, from the quotation\\nfield, date, author, work, and quotat text.  the result may\\nb view in the save queri window.  the system is still being\\ndevelop and is fairli rudimentari at the moment.  for instance,\\nsinc the earliest date of a word\\' occurr is not mark in\\nth data, one cannot find out what word in a particular field\\nfirst enter the language.  similarly, it is imposs to\\nsearch on the end of word or within a word.  no doubt thi will\\nb correct in time.\\n     the integr of the o and it four supplement is\\nexpect to be complet and publish in book form in the spring\\nof 1989, extend to 20 volumes.  the second edit of the oed\\nwil then be avail on cd-rom.  in the meantime, the\\nunivers of waterloo is develop two inquiri tools,\\ngener o extract
